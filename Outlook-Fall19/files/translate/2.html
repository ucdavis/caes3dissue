<br>
the views of those who have intimate knowledge
<br>
and personal investment in the decisions under
<br>
consideration. Her commitment to mentorship,
<br>
diversity and scholarship will help our team
<br>
meet the needs of communities across the globe.
<br>
<br>
Holyoak comes to us with a deep dedication
<br>
to the role environmental science and policy can
<br>
play in promoting sustainable environmental
<br>
management, social equality and healthy
<br>
communities. He became a faculty member in
<br>
the Department of Environmental Science and
<br>
Policy in 2000 and served as department chair
<br>
from 2016 to 2019. Over the last several years,
<br>
Holyoak has worked extensively to increase
<br>
course offerings and programs in environmental
<br>
and social justice.
<br>
<br>
Holyoak’s research focuses on the effects
<br>
of global change on animal populations
<br>
and communities, and the maintenance of
<br>
biodiversity in natural ecosystems. His work
<br>
contributes to the conservation of imperiled
<br>
species in California, and in understanding
<br>
changes in biodiversity in response to global
<br>
change. He has broad training in biostatistics,
<br>
theoretical ecology and experimental design,
<br>
and significant experience in interdisciplinary
<br>
environmental and social science.
<br>
<br>
With Owen’s and Holyoak’s vision and
<br>
leadership, our college will continue to provide
<br>
the research, engagement and resources
<br>
communities need to thrive.

and teamwork to address the
<br>
complex issues that face society
<br>
and to make sure people have
<br>
access to good nutrition, clean
<br>
air and water, health services
<br>
and other resources they need
<br>
to live healthy, productive
<br>
lives. Our college is dedicated
<br>
to working with communities,
<br>
fellow researchers and industry
<br>
to solve real-world challenges
<br>
so that, together, we can build
<br>
a better world for us all.
<br>
<br>
Two new members of our
<br>
college leadership team will
<br>
help us provide the science,
<br>
innovation and talented
<br>
graduates that communities
<br>
need to prosper. I am pleased
<br>
that Professor Patsy Eubanks
<br>
Owens, an expert in landscape
<br>
architecture and environmental
<br>
design, and Professor Marcel
<br>
Holyoak, an ecologist and instructor in
<br>
environmental science and policy, have joined
<br>
our team.
<br>
<br>
Professor Owens is our new associate dean
<br>
for human and social sciences, and Professor
<br>
Holyoak is our associate dean for environmental
<br>
sciences. Owens joined the UC Davis faculty in
<br>
1990 and has served as chair for both the
<br>
Departments of Environmental Design and
<br>
Human and Community Development, as
<br>
well as the inaugural chair of the Department
<br>
of Human Ecology. Owens’ research focuses
<br>
on the relationships between people and the
<br>
outdoor environment. She examines the role of
<br>
the physical environment in the development,
<br>
health and well-being of youth and methods
<br>
of community involvement in design
<br>
decision-making. Owens’ leadership style is much like her
<br>
approach to conducting community-based
<br>
design. She believes in listening and respecting
