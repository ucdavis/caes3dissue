Helping hands
<br>
Mauricio Guerrero-Villanueva, a clinical nutrition major, gets ready to volunteer at the Knights Landing
<br>
One Health Center Medical Clinic. Twice each month, the clinic unites UC Davis undergraduates, graduate
<br>
students and medical students with physicians and nurses to provide free healthcare to the medically
<br>
underserved in Knights Landing, La Tijera, Robbins and nearby migrant camps. Many student volunteers
<br>
are preparing for careers in healthcare. Undergraduate students act as interpreters, patient advocates,
<br>
receptionists and lab workers. UC Davis operates similar clinics throughout the Sacramento region to
<br>
improve access to healthcare for uninsured and low-income populations.
