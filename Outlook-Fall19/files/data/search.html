There will be no cannabis on campus or any UC Davis-owned or leased property as part of this research. The UC Davis Public Strawberry Breeding Program has released five new varieties that will help farmers manage diseases, control costs and produce plenty of large, robust berries using less water, fertilizer and pesticides. Two of the new varieties could increase yields by almost 30 percent. 	 “These new varieties are intrinsically different from the ones they replace,” said Professor Steve Knapp, director of the strawberry breeding program. “After three years of field tests, we’re seeing higher yields, greater disease resistance and better postharvest quality.” 	 The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of strawberries and almost 90 percent of them are grown in California. About 60 percent of the state’s strawberry fields are planted with varieties developed at UC Davis. 	 Each of the new varieties will have its own farming niche—thriving better in certain environments under specific growing conditions.

		<td>BY JOHN STUMBOS What scientists are beginning to learn about emissions from wildland fires ON NOVEMBER 8, 2018 , the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history ignited near the Sierra Nevada foothill community of Paradise. The Camp Fire, as it became known, burned more than 153,000 acres, destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and buildings, and killed at least 85 people. The wildfire’s smoke was trapped by a strong atmospheric inversion layer, dispersing it throughout the Sacramento Valley and even into the Bay Area. Air quality became so bad— about 10 times worse than the safety standard for particulate matter in Davis—that the campus closed for an extended period through Thanksgiving. Environmental toxicology professor Qi Zhang, an air quality expert, recognized a unique research opportunity and went into action. 	 “I’m interested in biomass burning,” she said. “So when the Camp Fire 6 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2019 happened, I stuck tubing outside the window of my lab on the fourth floor of Meyer Hall to collect air samples. I ran those through an aerosol mass spectrometer to measure the airborne particles.” Zhang also conducted a metal analysis with a device called a “Particle into Liquid Sampler” because this wasn’t an ordinary wildfire. Thousands of structures and their contents also went up in smoke. Based on initial indications, the smoke contained enhanced levels of heavy metals like copper and iron, but a thorough analysis has yet to be completed. Meanwhile, Professor Tony Wexler, an engineer in the Department of Land, Air and Water Resources and director of the Air Quality Research Center, was at work with Keith Bein, a researcher at the Center for Health and the Environment, developing a mobile monitoring system to collect air pollution from wildfires for chemical and toxicological analysis. They couldn’t get their mobile unit as close to the Camp Fire as they wanted because officials were keeping people away, but they’re geared up and ready to go at the next opportunity. “People have done a lot of studies on the health effects of wood smoke,” Wexler said. “But this is different. It’s houses that are burning, too, and we have a lot of stuff in our houses that you wouldn’t want to burn and breathe— plastics, pesticides, cleaning fluids and solvents, building materials.” Particulate matter in the atmosphere contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into the lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, also known as fine particles or PM2.5, </td>

The daily standard for maximum exposure to PM2.5 levels is 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. During the Camp Fire, levels exceeded 300 micrograms in parts of the region—some of the worst air quality in the world at the time. “That’s really hazardous on its own,” Zhang said. “When we look more closely at the composition of the particulate matter, it could be even more concerning.” So just how concerned should people be about breathing smoke from wildfires? The concentration of atmospheric pollutants is higher during wildfire events, but Wexler cautions against being alarmist: “The health effects of the anxiety about smoke may be worse than the health effects of the smoke itself. Nonetheless, individuals with asthma and other respiratory conditions are definitely at risk from wildfire smoke.” Susceptible populations, such as the young, are most at risk. In 2008, a number of wildfires filled the valley with smoke. Lisa Miller, a veterinary medicine professor and researcher at the primate center on campus, studied monkeys born that year and compared them with monkeys born a year later when the air was clear. Her research showed that infant monkeys exposed to wildfire smoke had an immune system with a depressed ability to respond to infectious agents when they became adolescents. There are other considerations brought by wildland fires burning in areas with homes and other urban development. After the Santa Rosa fires of 2017, local citizens were concerned about the impact of toxic air contaminants on locally grown produce. However, a study with the help of UC Cooperative Extension in Sonoma County found that produce safety was not significantly affected. An analysis of eggs from backyard chickens in the area by the School of Veterinary Medicine found a small percentage of properties affected by lead contamination but no obvious association with proximity to wildfire. Scientists acknowledge there is much to learn about wildfires and the smoke they produce. “Wildfires have become such a common phenomenon,” Zhang said. “There are a lot of unknowns when these particles are emitted, what the implications for human health are, and what the implication for the regional climate is. A lot of study needs to be performed.” • Plans in place to deal with wildfire impacts If wildfire smoke descends again upon the campus as it did last November, UC Davis will be ready.

		<td>Researchers race to keep citrus in our diets and communities BY DIANE NELSON when we put tasty tangerines in school lunches or make lemonade from the lemons on our backyard tree. CA&amp;ES researchers are working with farmers and state agriculture officials to keep it that way. “It’s hard to beat the flavor and nutrition of citrus,” says farmer Richard Bennett, reaching high to pull an orange from a tree near his home in Exeter, California. He peels it in two long ribbons and the fresh scent of zest fills the air. “Citrus is so important to our health and economy. I’m concerned that one day soon we will lose it all, not just here in California but around the world.” California produces 80 percent of the nation’s fresh citrus, most of it in small California communities like Exeter. UC economists say citrus production provides $7 billion to the state’s economy, including $500 million in wages. And oranges are a nutritional powerhouse, ripe with vitamin C, energy, fiber and a wide range of nutrients. Workers harvest navel oranges in Exeter, California.

		<td>helps us out, fresh citrus might be able to hold on.” FIGHTING WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE The bacterium that causes HLB is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, a tiny insect that feeds on citrus leaves and stems. Infected trees can look healthy for years, all the while serving as reservoirs of disease. Symptoms emerge over time as a dying tree’s fruit turns misshapen, bitter-tasting and green—which is how it got the name, “citrus greening.” There isn’t a cure yet, so dozens of CA&amp;ES researchers, including Professor Slupsky, are developing effective, affordable ways to spot it early in order to slow the spread while they explore long-term solutions like disease- resistant varieties. The work is complicated by the fact that the HLB bacterium, like some other microbes, is “unculturable,” which means it can’t be grown outside the host and studied in a petri dish. “To understand how the infection works and find ways to fight it, we have to perform experiments within infected plants,” says Gitta Coaker, a CA&amp;ES professor in plant pathology. “That’s harder and more time consuming because we have fewer tools available to test possible antimicrobials, and it is laborious to identify genes that influence disease resistance. And, trees take a long time to grow.” Coaker and her team are developing ways to test citrus plants for resistance at a very early stage, which could speed up the breeding process by identifying genes that influence important traits. The state citrus industry is investing more than $40 million annually to improve methods to detect HLB-infected trees and develop a cure. Citrus grower Bennett finds hope in the science and collaboration. “I’m afraid we may already be too late, but I do find optimism in the research,” he says. “Science is our last hope.” • How can you recognize signs of the disease in your own backyard trees? The Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Program website provides photos and tips on what to look for and who to call to help control the spread. californiacitrusthreat.org JOE PROUDMAN/UC Davis Citrus is threatened by a disease called Huanglongbing or HLB—more commonly known as citrus greening—that has decimated groves in Asia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and Florida. The disease is now spreading in California. “If we don’t act quickly, we could lose all fresh citrus within 10 to 15 years,” says Carolyn Slupsky, CA&amp;ES professor of nutrition and food science. “Losing citrus would be devastating to people’s health and livelihoods and even change the way we cook and eat. No lime for our guacamole, no lemon on our fish.” Citrus greening can move with alarming speed. In Florida, the disease was first detected in 2005. Fourteen years later, orange production has fallen by more than 75 percent and grapefruit production is down 85 percent. Backyard citrus has virtually disappeared in some areas. In California, state agriculture officials have detected HLB in more than 1,500 trees, a number that grows by about 60 each week as officials inspect and remove suspect trees. An infected tree can live for years without symptoms, so the number of dying citrus trees in California may be much higher. So far, infected trees have been found mainly in backyards in Southern California. Officials say there is no guarantee the pathogen hasn’t already spread to commercial groves or to the Central Valley, but they hold out hope. “Some people believe that citrus in the Central Valley might be spared because of the climate—that the winters are too cold and summers too hot for the insects that transmit the disease,” says Associate Professor Neil McRoberts, a plant disease epidemiologist and scientific advisor to the Citrus Research Board of California. “But it looks like the Central Valley temperatures are right at the threshold, so a few degrees warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer could change that.

		<td>FACULTY PROFILE Improving human health from inside and out BY DIANE NELSON EVEN WHEN HE WAS A BOY GROWING UP IN MARIN COUNTY , Daniel Choe wondered why some kids were more prone to behavioral problems. “Some of my peers got involved with drugs, fighting and crime,” said Choe, who is now an assistant professor in the CA&amp;ES Department of Human Ecology. “I felt bad seeing them damage their minds and bodies and futures. In retrospect, I see it gave me empathy for why people make certain choices. It made me wonder, ‘How can we prevent and treat behavioral problems so people can lead more fulfilling lives?’.” That question drives Choe to this day as he builds an innovative child development program at UC Davis, where he was hired in 2014. Choe is exploring which experiences in early childhood can contribute to mental health problems later in life. He looks at family and neighborhood influences, such as poverty and violence, and a child’s capacity to “self-regulate” or manage their emotions and behavior in stressful situations. “We have a lot to learn about how self-control and social competence allow children to suppress problem behaviors and overcome environmental stressors,” said Choe. “But interventions that only target self-regulation are not a panacea. Aside from individual differences in people’s ability to cope, there are also systemic, institutional reasons why certain populations are at greater risks for breaking the law. We need to look at it as a whole. To build healthy communities, we have to first meet people’s basic needs.” Marshmallows and delayed gratification In the early 1970s, Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel launched a long-term study on delayed gratification that still informs the study of self-regulation. “It’s called the marshmallow test, though we don’t use marshmallows anymore,” Choe said. “They’re considered a choking hazard.” The experiment works like this: A child about 4 to 6 years old sits in a room with a small treat. The youngster is given the option of eating it now or getting two treats if he or she can wait maybe 15 minutes. Decades later, researchers discovered that the children who waited longer for the reward were significantly more likely to lead healthy and successful lives as measured by things like Body Mass Index, SAT scores, 12 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2019 lucrative jobs and stable relationships. “The positive effects of early self-regulation were more powerful than children’s IQ and family income in predicting success later in life,” Choe said. Choe recently received a UC Davis Hellman Fellowship Award, which supports early- career faculty, to investigate the development of self- regulation in children and families in Yolo County. Choe’s lab uses a form of the marshmallow test along with other methods to assess impulse control and resilience to adversity. Choe also studies intergenerational family dynamics, because how we were raised influences our own parenting behavior. And he measures parental stress and maternal mood. “A mother’s depression is a risk factor for a whole host of problems, including difficulties self-regulating,” Choe said. “That’s why addressing institutional issues—like adopting reasonable family leave policies—is so important to child welfare. It’s all connected.” Trust matters Trust plays a big role in self-regulation and the choices we make. “Sometimes, what looks like a bad decision can be perfectly reasonable based on experience,” Choe said. Over the years, psychologists have conducted variations of the marshmallow test. In one permutation, some children worked with a trustworthy adult and others did not. “The untrustworthy adult would promise to bring the child nice crayons, for example, and show up with a few broken </td>

Context is everything when seeking to treat and prevent behavioral problems. Choe says parents can help children develop self-regulation by providing a safe, loving, predictable environment. Schools and workplaces can offer meditation to help people manage stress. “But for people dealing with basic survival, who are wondering where they might find their next meal, meditation isn’t enough,” Choe said. “To improve mental health, our society must also address larger issues like education and income inequality.” That’s where working together can help. “I love being at UC Davis and in this college,” said Choe, who is also a faculty affiliate with the UC Davis Center for Poverty Research. “There is a commitment to collaboration and service to improve people’s lives.

		<td>THE STUDENT STORY Student explores connection between exercise and mood increase physical activity and improve your mood? Not necessarily. In a new study, recent UC Davis graduate Jody Zhou and Human Ecology Associate Professor Siwei Liu found that after 100 days of wearing a Fitbit, participants tended to exercise less and feel more depressed than before they started monitoring their activity. The research may shed light on the link between exercise and mood. “We found a significant decrease in activity throughout the 100 days and that corresponded with an increase in participants’ depressive mood symptoms,” said Zhou, who will begin graduate studies in the Department of Human Ecology this fall. Zhou received her B.S. in Cognitive Science from the College of Letters and Sciences in 2018. “Moods improved among those who exercised more and depressive symptoms increased for those who exercised less.” Zhou conducted the study in 2018 as part of a class project led by Professor Liu, who specializes in quantitative methodology to study human development. Liu uses new technologies like smartphones and wearable devices to develop innovative ways to measure physiological and emotional responses to social interactions. Zhou capitalized on Liu’s methodology to explore the connection between exercise and depression. “The scientific literature says that physical activity can reduce depres- sion, but there’s not a lot of research on the cognitive mechanism of why that is so,” Zhou said. “We believe it has to do with self-efficacy, or the confidence in our ability to accomplish a task and succeed. When we achieve a goal, we feel good about ourselves, and that reduces stress.” In the study, Zhou and Liu asked 196 participants to wear a Fitbit for 100 days. Participants customized their daily goals. Researchers didn’t monitor who completed their tasks. “Our aim was to see how people behave in the real world, so we didn’t intervene in their fitness routines,” Liu said. Before the experiment began, Zhou and Liu assessed each participant’s baseline depression by asking questions like, “How often during the past two weeks did you feel hopeless or depressed? Tired or low energy? Have trouble staying asleep or sleeping too much?” They asked the same questions during two follow-up interviews. “Most people had more negative moods after the self-monitoring period,” Liu said. “Many participants were excited to get started with the Fitbit. But once the novelty wore off, they reverted to old habits and their physical activity declined. That may help explain their negative feelings.” Zhou looks forward to furthering her studies in statistics and human behavior. “I was so inspired by Dr. Liu’s class,” Zhou said from her home in China. “I learned that applied statistics can help social scientists develop innovative methods to explore important questions in human development.” —Diane Nelson 14 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2019 HECTOR AMEZCUA/UC Davis CAN TRACKING YOUR STEPS WITH ELECTRONIC DEVICES </td>

		<td>Keeping food safe from farm table to by Diane Nelson BOB NICHOLS/Flicker OUR MOTHERS WERE RIGHT: We should eat our greens—and golds, purples, oranges and reds. A grow- ing body of research shows that eating a wide variety of produce and protein can promote health, prevent disease and even stave off the effects of aging. In short, farm-fresh food is good for us. But it’s confusing and concerning when products like lettuce, spinach, eggs, peanut butter—you name it—are recalled due to exposure to foodborne pathogens that have the potential to make us sick. How can we be sure our food is safe? “There will always be some risk of contamination from anything that’s grown outdoors and handled by humans,” said Linda Harris, Cooperative Extension specialist and chair of the CA&amp;ES food science and technology department. “But our researchers work to promote food safety at each stage of the food production process to significantly minimize the risk.” Food recalls have seen an uptick in recent years, but Harris says that’s because we’re better at detecting potential problems. “We can detect them faster and more accurately, which means—especially with perishable products—there’s a greater chance the product is still in the marketplace when we discover there’s something to recall,” Harris said. “When food is recalled before people get sick, by far the most common situation, it means the mechanisms are in place to keep us safe.” CA&amp;ES faculty work with farmers, processors, packers, shippers, retailers and consumers to promote food safety with hundreds of agricultural commodities. As an example, let’s look at leafy greens like lettuce and spinach as they make their way from farm to table. Continue to the next page.

Water used for irrigation and other agricultural needs can increase the risk of foodborne illness if it’s not clean. Any water that has the potential to come in contact with edible portions of the plant must comply with stringent food safety guidelines for leafy greens. MANAGING MANURE Manure can be an economical, practical source of the nutrients plants need to grow. But raw manure can harbor potential foodborne pathogens. Untreated manure cannot be used on lettuce or leafy greens. Instead, growers can use only properly composted soil amendments for these and many other crops. WHERE ANIMALS ROAM Produce-related outbreaks are sometimes traced to plants and watersheds contaminated by domesticated animals like livestock, wild animals and birds. CA&amp;ES faculty work with lettuce growers to identify sustainable approaches that minimize crop contamination and protect wildlife and the natural environment. COURTNEY KEATING/iStock It’s all about preventing contamination, which can come from water, soil, animals, equipment and humans. Researchers conduct studies that help identify food safety challenges and work with small- and large-scale farmers to find solutions. BOB NICHOLS LANCE CHEUNG On the farm </td>

		<td>IMPROVED PACKAGING UC Davis researchers are also developing antimicrobial packaging that both repels bacteria and reduces the microbes that cause food to spoil. The new plastic material could be used to line produce bins and wrap produce to improve safety and freshness. Distribution Lettuce and leafy greens sometimes have to travel long distances to reach consumers. To promote postharvest quality and safety, distributors keep transport vehicles clean and make sure produce stays chilled all the way to the grocery shelf. Courtesy Photo Consumers By the time leafy greens reach your kitchen, producers, regulators and researchers have worked together to ensure safety. Here’s what you can do at home. FRESHNESS MATTERS CHILL Buy leafy greens that are fresh and not bruised, whether in or out of a package. For packaged salads, check the best-if-consumed-by date. Packaged salads should be refrigerated in the store and at home. SEPARATE CLEAN Keep leafy greens away from household chemicals and raw meat, poultry and seafood in your shopping cart, check-out bag and refrigerator. Don’t prepare leafy greens with the same knife or cutting board used with raw poultry, meat and seafood unless your tools have been washed with hot water and soap. Rinse head lettuce or fresh leafy greens under cool tap water. Packaged leafy greens labeled “ready to eat” or “triple washed” do not need to be rinsed. Never wash lettuce with bleach or detergent. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling lettuce and leafy greens. GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis Processing After harvest, produce may be washed, sorted, packaged and chilled. CA&amp;ES faculty are working to develop technologies to help processors keep water and equipment clean while preserving the flavor and nutrition of leafy greens. </td>

		<td>MAKING A DIFFERENCE Bez Tabesh presents Dean Dillard with a gift to the college at the annual Scholarship Reception. ACADEMIC TECHNOLOGY SERVICES/UC Davis Inspirational scholarship recipient believes in a culture of giving has a story to tell. It’s about finding opportunity in challenge and about showing gratitude for those helping his dreams come true. “It feels like a miracle that I’m here studying clinical nutrition on a path toward a career in physical therapy,” he said. Growing up in the Bay Area, he was bullied for being the new, overweight Persian kid in middle school. In high school, he battled back from depression and loneliness when he discovered the transformative power of exercise. He became a personal trainer and, at one point, even set up a gym in his parents’ garage. Then tragedy struck. Tabesh was hit by a car while riding his bike and fractured his hip. “It felt like the worst thing in the world,” he said. “But during my rehabilitation process, I fell in love with physical therapy. My path began to make sense.” He buckled down at the local community college and set his sights first on UC Davis to study clinical nutrition and eventually for physical therapy school at UC San Francisco. He transferred to Davis in 2017. His hard work paid off when he found support from two people he didn’t even know. Lisa Harris and her sister, Dina Bosby, created UC DAVIS STUDENT BEHZOD “BEZ” TABESH “ I hope my gift helps a student who can benefit from the financial support the same way I have. I believe in a culture of giving. ” 18 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2019 the Joseph A. and Jean M. Teresi Memorial Scholarship at UC Davis to honor their parents. The scholarship is for a nutrition major one year and a student of any major intending to become a K-8 school teacher the next. Tabesh is the first recipient of that scholarship, and it’s made a huge difference in his life during a particularly difficult time for his family. His father had been diagnosed with a rare disease that claimed his life. “My scholarship gave me the chance to take care of my family in ways that I couldn’t before,” Tabesh said. “My mom didn’t need to worry about my tuition, housing or expenses at all. And it helped me find the mental therapy I needed in dealing with my dad’s death.” At an event last spring to honor scholarship recipients and their donors, Tabesh delivered a moving speech. “You ignite a potential in us that enables us to persevere,” he said. “You uplift our spirits through tough times and believe in us.” Then he surprised everyone with a check to the UC Davis Foundation. “Because of my experience, I want to give back, as well,” he said. “I hope my gift helps a student who can benefit from the financial support the same way I have. I believe in a culture of giving.” —John Stumbos UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 18 </td>

		<td>Jill Carmel Photography ALUMNI FOCUS The Khaira family (left to right): Meera, Ravinder, Navneet and Kamal. “Ravi” and Kamal are UC Davis alumni. Meera is a current UC Davis student and Navneet is attending Georgetown University. Giving back comes naturally to this family Seva is the Sikh word for selfless service and is a central part of the Khaira family’s beliefs. Kamal and her husband, Ravinder, both UC Davis alumni, have found many ways to be of service to their alma mater. One way is through char- itable gifts and pledges to support experiential learning funds in both the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and in the College of Biological Sciences. The Khairas believe it’s very important to give students the opportunity to expand their education beyond the classroom. They also established the Ted Bradshaw Engaged Student Scholars Program in honor of Kamal’s late mentor. This program con- nects students with com- munity leaders to address real-world problems. 20 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2019 Kamal Khaira returns to campus to lead UC’s CalFresh Healthy Living KAMAL KHAIRA IS BACK ON CAMPUS –as director of UC’s CalFresh Healthy Living, a program that delivers nutrition education through county Cooperative Extension offices. She’s a natural fit for the job. Khaira first came to UC Davis in 1988 to pursue a career in sports medicine. Through an undergraduate internship she discovered that wasn’t at all what she wanted to do. A counselor suggested she look into corporate wellness, so Khaira found a position with Pacific Bell’s corporate offices in San Francisco. “I was exposed to this model of prevention that I didn’t know much about but loved it,” she said. Khaira next worked for Sacramento County as a health educator targeting at-risk youth in continuation high schools, group homes and juvenile hall. Kaiser Hospital recruited her to run its health education center in Roseville. Then she met her future husband, Ravinder, a medical resident at Loma Linda University, and moved to Southern California. There she landed an executive-level job with the American Heart Association and led a campaign on heart disease and stroke prevention awareness. After her twin daughters were born, she focused on family until the girls entered preschool. The public health muse came calling again and led her to Ted Bradshaw, a professor of human and community development at UC Davis in 2004. “My whole career involved community-based health programs,” she said. “And I wanted to learn more about the theory around it.” At the age of 34, Khaira was a student again, working toward a master’s in community development. She set up an ambitious project at six pilot sites around the state focusing on middle and high school students. “They learned about the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity,” she said. “But they also had leadership and civic engagement opportunities to experience how their actions affect their communities.” In Del Norte County, for example, students got the school board to replace dysfunctional water fountains with new hydration stations. In West Oakland, they created Mandela Grocery, a worker-owned cooperative stocked with healthy food from local farmers. “Hundreds of youth have been touched by these engagement projects,” she said. Khaira became director of CalFresh Healthy Living in June 2018. Her goal is to infuse the program with that same co-creation philosophy she honed as a graduate student. “When communities are involved, they feel ownership and we see stronger impacts and outcomes,” she said.
