		<paragraph><![CDATA[damage their minds and bodies and futures. In retrospect, I ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[It made me wonder, ‘How can we prevent and treat behavioral ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[That question drives Choe to this day as he builds an ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[poverty and violence, and a child’s capacity to “self-regulate” or ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[manage their emotions and behavior in stressful situations. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We have a lot to learn about how self-control and social ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[competence allow children to suppress problem behaviors ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and overcome environmental stressors,” said Choe. “But ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[interventions that only target self-regulation are not a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[panacea. Aside from individual differences in people’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[ability to cope, there are also systemic, institutional reasons ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[marshmallows anymore,” Choe said. “They’re considered a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[choking hazard.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The experiment works like this: A child about 4 to 6 ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[years old sits in a room with a small treat. The youngster is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[given the option of eating it now or getting two treats if he or ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[she can wait maybe 15 minutes. Decades later, researchers ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Not necessarily. In a new study, recent UC Davis graduate Jody Zhou ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and Human Ecology Associate Professor Siwei Liu found that after 100 ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[days of wearing a Fitbit, participants tended to exercise less and feel more ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[depressed than before they started monitoring their activity. The research ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[may shed light on the link between exercise and mood. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We found a significant decrease in activity throughout the 100 days ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and that corresponded with an increase in participants’ depressive mood ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[symptoms,” said Zhou, who will begin graduate studies in the Department ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of Human Ecology this fall. Zhou received her B.S. in Cognitive Science ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from the College of Letters and Sciences in 2018. “Moods improved among ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[those who exercised more and depressive symptoms increased for those ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[who exercised less.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Zhou conducted the study in 2018 as part of a class project led by ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Professor Liu, who specializes in quantitative methodology to study ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[human development. Liu uses new technologies like smartphones and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[wearable devices to develop innovative ways to measure physiological ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and emotional responses to social interactions. Zhou capitalized on Liu’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[methodology to explore the connection between exercise and depression. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“The scientific literature says that physical activity can reduce depres- ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[sion, but there’s not a lot of research on the cognitive mechanism of why ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that is so,” Zhou said. “We believe it has to do with self-efficacy, or the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[confidence in our ability to accomplish a task and succeed. When we ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[achieve a goal, we feel good about ourselves, and that reduces stress.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[In the study, Zhou and Liu asked 196 participants to wear a Fitbit for ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[100 days. Participants customized their daily goals. Researchers didn’t ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[monitor who completed their tasks. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Our aim was to see how people behave in the real world, so we didn’t ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[intervene in their fitness routines,” Liu said. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Before the experiment began, Zhou and Liu assessed each participant’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[baseline depression by asking questions like, “How often during the past ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[two weeks did you feel hopeless or depressed? Tired or low energy? Have ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[trouble staying asleep or sleeping too much?” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[They asked the same questions during two follow-up interviews. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Most people had more negative moods after the self-monitoring ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[period,” Liu said. “Many participants were excited to get started with the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Fitbit. But once the novelty wore off, they reverted to old habits and their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[physical activity declined. That may help explain their negative feelings.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Zhou looks forward to furthering her studies in statistics and human ]]></paragraph>
