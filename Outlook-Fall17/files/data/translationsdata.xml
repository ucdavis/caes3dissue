		<paragraph><![CDATA[in fields such as ecology, conservation biology, ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[the lab looks out on coastline rich with kelp, ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[an environmental oceanographer with a special ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[interest in upwelling and a resident faculty ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[member at BML. “The laboratory is such a ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[The deep ocean acts as a compost heap of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[sorts, ripe with decayed matter that sinks down ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from above. Deep water is cold, low in oxygen, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and more acidic than the ocean’s surface. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[When this cold, nutrient-rich water surges ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[up from below to replace surface waters that ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[are pushed out to sea by prevailing winds ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[give researchers a window into how climate ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[marine organisms. “The deep ocean is naturally ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[acidic and hypoxic—two of the changes that we ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[think will characterize the future ocean,” said ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Andrew Whitehead, a UC Davis professor of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[environmental toxicology who conducts research ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[at BML. In upwelling areas, organisms exposed ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[low oxygen and high acidity. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[About 30 percent of the carbon dioxide ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[acidification. “Ocean acidification as a consequence of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[climate change is a great threat for many marine ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[organisms, especially those that make shells,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[said Whitehead. At BML, researchers are working ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[effects of ocean acidification on shellfish such as ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[is studying the combined effects of ocean ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[acidification and hypoxia during the marine ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[that reside inside and outside the California ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[upwelling zone, they hope to see whether there ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Department of Animal Science who specializes ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[in how aquatic life copes with changing ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[environments. Todgham studies stress in sea ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[creatures in a wide variety of locations, including ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the ice-covered continent at the southern tip of ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Oceans absorb about one-third of the ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[atmosphere. That may be good for the air, but ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[it is hard on the health of the sea. Climate change ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and marine pollution are stressing virtually all ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[aquatic life, but Todgham says polar species may ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[have it the worst. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Cold water holds more CO 2 , so carbon ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[dioxide levels are rising very fast in Antarctica,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Todgham said. “Polar species are generally ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[long-lived—80-plus years, in some cases—so ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[they can’t evolve fast enough to keep pace with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[warming water and rising acidity. They can’t ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[migrate to colder water. They have to adapt by ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[recruiting their existing physiology, and so far, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that doesn’t look very promising.” ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[happening all along our coastlines, affecting ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Studying fish in Antarctica is not for the ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Todgham studies two polar fish species—the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[naked dragon fish and the emerald rockcod—that ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[live in the dark waters beneath thick ice shelves. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[To reach the fish, researchers drill through nine ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[feet of ice and scuba divers search for the species’ ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[eggs and juveniles in polar water where even the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[worms and sea spiders are supersized. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Cold water holds more oxygen, so aquatic ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[life can get really big down there,” Todgham ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[explained. Researchers transport the specimens in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[temperature-controlled vehicles to the research ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[station to keep them alive. Polar species have ]]></paragraph>
