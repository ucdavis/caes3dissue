and that should come as no surprise. Our campus is located in the heart of
<br>
California’s Central Valley at the confluence of freshwater and marine ecosystems.
<br>
<br>
Our expertise connects those systems—from the crest of the Sierra Nevada to
<br>
California’s coastal areas and beyond. In this issue we look at research into the
<br>
marine environment and innovative education programs preparing our students
<br>
to lead on coastal issues.
