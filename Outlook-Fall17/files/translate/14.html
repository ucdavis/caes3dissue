at various locations along California’s 1,100-mile

coast, and UC Davis researchers are helping

develop the tools to manage these areas for

future generations.
<br>
<br>
After eight years of planning, analysis,
<br>
workshops, and stakeholder input from
<br>
fishermen, environmentalists, and others,
<br>
the state of California established an extensive
<br>
network of Marine Protected
<br>
Areas (MPAs) in 2012 to protect
<br>
and conserve marine life and

<br>
“With marine reserves, our
<br>
models show it’s a win-win
<br>
situation,” Hastings said. “You can have

the harvest you would like from your target
<br>
species while at the same time benefiting the
<br>
weak stocks.”

Hastings is part of a team of scientists at
<br>
UC Davis and elsewhere who are studying how
<br>
to most effectively manage marine reserves.
<br>
<br>
“We’re using mathematical models to
<br>
determine when and how much we expect
<br>
fish that we harvest to respond to California’s
<br>
no-fishing zones,” said Marissa Baskett, an
<br>
environmental science and policy professor
<br>
who specializes in marine reserves. “In other
<br>
locations around the world, marine reserves
<br>
harbor larger fish and larger population sizes,
<br>
as well as greater total biomass and diversity.”
<br>
Baskett and colleagues are comparing model
<br>
predictions with actual field data to identify
<br>
shortfalls so the state can make informed
<br>
management adjustments. These models have
<br>
been developed with Hastings; wildlife, fish and
<br>
conservation biology professor Louis Botsford; and
<br>
former UC Davis postdoctoral student Will White,
<br>
now a professor at Oregon State University.
<br>
<br>
“Our work will help improve management
<br>
of marine protected areas to support both the
<br>
nutrition and recreation that Californians derive
<br>
from the sea,” Baskett said. “In addition, we
<br>
can serve as a leading example of model-based
<br>
adaptive management that could be applied to
<br>
MPAs throughout the world.”
