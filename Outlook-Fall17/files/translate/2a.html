From the Dean
<br>
Working together to protect marine resources
<br>
for its leadership
<br>
in the agricultural sciences, our programs in
<br>
human and environmental sciences are also
<br>
among the best in the nation.
<br>
<br>
A striking example of this is in the marine and
<br>
coastal sciences. We have many faculty members
<br>
working in this field, and in the pages that follow,
<br>
we feature some of that work: on ocean upwelling,
<br>
marine protected areas, endangered white abalone,
<br>
the sustainability of seafood, and other areas.
<br>
<br>
In 2013, faculty from our college and the
<br>
College of Biological Sciences (CBS) worked
<br>
together to create the Coastal and Marine Sciences
<br>
Institute. This institute aims to coordinate and
<br>
promote research, foster partnerships, and
<br>
host symposia and other educational events. In
<br>
addition, a relatively new undergraduate major
<br>
in marine and coastal science draws upon the
<br>
capabilities from our college, as well as those of
<br>
CBS and the College of Letters and Science.
<br>
<br>
At the heart of much of this activity is the
<br>
50-year-old Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML), a
<br>
mini-campus on the Sonoma Coast and a portal
<br>
to one of the most productive marine ecosystems
<br>
in the world. Scientists and students at BML come
<br>
from many different disciplines and reap the
<br>
benefit of a culture of collaboration that is part
<br>
of our land-grant tradition. Some of our students
<br>
WHILE UC DAVIS IS RENOWNED
<br>
spend part of their summer exploring fascinating
<br>
areas of coastal and marine science at BML in a
<br>
resident program.
<br>
<br>
We see other encouraging signs of growth in
<br>
this field, such as a recent $3 million grant from
<br>
the National Science Foundation to train the next
<br>
generation of marine scientists. This effort will
<br>
give greater emphasis to policy in the research
<br>
and training enterprise for more effective linkages
<br>
between marine science and resource-management
<br>
decisions. The project will train 60 Ph.D. students
<br>
in fields such as ecology, conservation biology,
<br>
economics, geology, physiology, biogeochemistry,
<br>
and oceanography. Trainees will be recruited from
<br>
a diversity of populations, with special attention
<br>
to students from natural resource-dependent
<br>
communities. The program will help shape the
<br>
future of a new marine science Ph.D. program at
<br>
UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
With our partners throughout the campus
<br>
and beyond, we are building new capabilities
<br>
to address the challenges and opportunities
<br>
where the land meets the sea. This is an exciting
<br>
time for the university. Our goal is to become a
<br>
global leader helping to ensure the sustainability
<br>
of oceans and the resources we draw from them.

and that should come as no surprise. Our campus is located in the heart of
<br>
California’s Central Valley at the confluence of freshwater and marine ecosystems.
<br>
<br>
Our expertise connects those systems—from the crest of the Sierra Nevada to
<br>
California’s coastal areas and beyond. In this issue we look at research into the
<br>
marine environment and innovative education programs preparing our students
<br>
to lead on coastal issues.
