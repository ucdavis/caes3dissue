<br>
Students who like working with people are drawn to the human
<br>
development major.
<br>
<br>
NEW LEADERSHIP
<br>
Chancellor May
<br>
In April, UC Davis launched a weekly blog aimed at current and
<br>
prospective students who are wondering, “What Can I Do with
<br>
My Major?” The blog offers undergraduates a closer look at the
<br>
career paths of alumni in their field, as well as insights from
<br>
currently enrolled students—why they chose that major, what
<br>
they study, and what they hope to do after graduation.
<br>
<br>
Reader response has been enthusiastic; the new site garnered
<br>
more than 10,000 page views in its first five weeks. Mixed in
<br>
with blogs on individual majors are advice posts such as “6
<br>
Steps to Take at College for Job Success” and “5 Tips for New
<br>
Graduates Looking for a Job.”
<br>
The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences has
<br>
by far the most popular blog post on the site so far—“What Can
<br>
I Do with a Managerial Economics Major?” The major attracts
<br>
students seeking preparation for a career in business.

<br>
<br>
An accomplished scholar and

<br>
nearly three decades at the Georgia
<br>
Institute of Technology in Atlanta,

<br>
<br>
In 2010, May was named
<br>
“outstanding engineering alumnus”
<br>
of UC Berkeley, where he earned his
<br>
master’s and Ph.D. degrees in electrical
<br>
engineering and computer science.
<br>

<br>
Anita Oberbauer, professor and chair
<br>
of the Department of Animal Science,
<br>
has become the college’s new associate
<br>
dean for research and outreach in
<br>
agricultural programs. Oberbauer
<br>
takes over for entomology professor
<br>
Ed Lewis, who took a position at the
<br>
University of Idaho.
<br>
<br>
Oberbauer received her B.S. in
<br>
zoology at UC Davis and her Ph.D.
<br>
<br>
in animal science from Cornell
<br>
University before joining the animal
<br>
science faculty at UC Davis in 1989.

Student Farm Director Ullmann

of the UC Davis Student Farm. She
<br>

<br>
after 30 years at the helm.
<br>
<br>
Ullmann earned her Ph.D. in entomology
<br>
at UC Davis in 2014, and most recently
<br>
served as a crop pollination specialist
<br>
for the Xerxes Society for Invertebrate
<br>
Conservation. Her professional background
