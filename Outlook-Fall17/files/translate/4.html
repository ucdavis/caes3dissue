Constructing California
<br>
2 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2017

<br>
Lego lovers got a treat on Picnic Day, with a demonstration
<br>
of coastal fog dispersion throughout an 8-foot by 4-foot
<br>
plastic brick model of the state of California.
<br>
<br>
Environmental science and management major Chris
<br>
Zaleski took on the task of building the map of California
<br>
as an intern for the Department of Land, Air and Water
<br>
Resources (LAWR). His meticulously constructed model
<br>
of 32,000 Lego bricks is topographical, built to scale and has
<br>
taken hundreds of hours to assemble. Brick colors reflect
<br>
types of land use—for example, red indicates urban areas,
<br>
blue is water, and dark green is forest. The tallest point,
<br>
Mount Whitney, is 26 Lego bricks high. The goal is to help
<br>
viewers see why California has such varied ecology and is
<br>
so rich in biodiversity.
<br>
<br>
Zaleski has been putting finishing touches on the
<br>
California model over the summer in his spare time and
<br>
hopes to finish it this fall. When complete, LAWR will make
<br>
the model available for viewing to the public in Davis prior
<br>
to exhibition at various science museums throughout the
<br>
state, and ultimately, Legoland.
