MAKING A DIFFERENCE
<br>
Endowment empowers research
<br>
of environmental contaminants
<br>
“The spill quickly overwhelmed the ability to
<br>
contain it,” he said. “The only choice was to let
<br>
it go unabated or to disperse it.” The team made
<br>
a difficult decision to inject dispersants directly
<br>
into the wellhead, which helped limit damage to
<br>
marine life.
<br>
<br>
LONG BEFORE THE 2010 DEEPWATER HORIZON
<br>
oil spill wreaked havoc in the Gulf of Mexico,
<br>
toxicologist Ron Tjeerdema developed analytical
<br>
tools to understand petrochemical catastrophes
<br>
in the aquatic environment.
<br>
<br>
Tjeerdema studied aquatic toxicology with
<br>
UC Davis Professor Donald Crosby in the 1980s
<br>
and, after obtaining his Ph.D., was hired by
<br>
UC Santa Cruz to create an oil spill research
<br>
program at Granite Canyon south of Carmel.
<br>
<br>
“We put together oil spill methods back in the
<br>
early 1990s that were a generation ahead of
<br>
what was used at the time,” Tjeerdema said.
<br>
<br>
When millions of gallons of Louisiana
<br>
crude escaped from Deepwater Horizon, a
<br>
quickly assembled team of 50 scientists from
<br>
industry, government, and academia, including
<br>
Tjeerdema, wrestled with how to minimize the
<br>
ecological damage.

16 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2017
<br>
“The nice thing about the endowment
<br>
is we can focus on research that I might
<br>
otherwise not have funding for.”
<br>
After Crosby retired in the ’90s, Tjeerdema
<br>
returned to UC Davis as a professor in the
<br>
Department of Environmental Toxicology. Today,
<br>
he serves as associate dean for environmental
<br>
programs, was recently appointed to a National
<br>
Academy of Sciences committee that will
<br>
update oil spill response guidelines, and
<br>
holds the Donald G. Crosby Endowed Chair
<br>
in Environmental Chemistry. The chair was
<br>
established in 2010 by a donation from the estate
<br>
of the late Charley Soderquist—another Crosby
<br>
protégé who earned his Ph.D. in the 1970s.
<br>
<br>
The endowment enabled Tjeerdema to
<br>
purchase a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer
<br>
that helps students and faculty analyze pesticides
<br>
and their degradation byproducts, as well as
<br>
biochemical changes in organisms exposed to
<br>
contaminants. Additionally, the endowment
<br>
provides graduate student support.
<br>
<br>
“The nice thing about the endowment is we
<br>
can focus on research that I might otherwise not
<br>
have funding for,” he said. “We can move into
<br>
new areas with students.”
<br>
One such area is environmental metabolomics
<br>
to better understand the effects of crude and
<br>
dispersed oil in fishes. The endowment gives
<br>
Tjeerdema and his students more flexibility
<br>
to study the fate of other environmental
<br>
contaminants such as pesticides and antibiotics.
