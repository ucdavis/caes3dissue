<br>
Department of Food Science and Technology, Fox
<br>
will teach and conduct brewing science research.

Awards Developmental psychologist Amanda
<br>
Guyer, a professor in the Department of
<br>
Human Ecology, is among the 2019 class of
<br>
fellows of the Association for Psychological
<br>
Science. Guyer investigates the neural and
<br>
behavioral underpinnings of adolescent psychopathology,
<br>
such as depression, anxiety and substance abuse through
<br>
social, emotional and cognitive processes.
<br>
<br>
Three CA&ES faculty members—Daniel
<br>
Choe (human ecology), Yanhong Liu
<br>
(animal science) and Barbara Blanco-Ulate
<br>
(plant sciences)—have been awarded 2019
<br>
fellowships from the Hellman Fellows Fund,
<br>
which supports early-career faculty. Choe is
<br>
examining whether low-income toddlers’ and
<br>
mothers’ social, behavioral and physiological
<br>
regulation protect against poverty-related
<br>
stressors. Liu explores dietary alternatives
<br>
to antibiotic growth promoters in livestock
<br>
and poultry. Blanco-Ulate is examining how
<br>
particular changes in genetic regulation
<br>
during fruit ripening impact the ability of
<br>
fruit to fight disease.
