		<paragraph><![CDATA[Jay Belsky, professor of human development. “Many of the ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Swartz and others have discovered that measures of brain ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[predict later psychiatric conditions. Working with Professor ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Ahmad Hariri at Duke University, Swartz analyzed the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[brain scans of 340 college students while they were looking ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[at images of angry or fearful faces. Swartz and colleagues ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[measured activity in the students’ amygdala—the tiny ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[emotion-processing center of the brain—to see how active ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[it was in response to the threatening stimuli. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[After the measurements were taken, the students answered ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[experienced more severe symptoms in response to later ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[stressful situations in their lives. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“By identifying genetic markers that predict these patterns ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[three years, testing them for symptoms of depression and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[scanning their brain activity in response to photos of fearful ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[faces. During the course of the study, children from more ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[disadvantaged families had greater methylation—a process ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that can change the way genes behave—of a gene that controls ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[levels of serotonin, which can affect a person’s mood. Children ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[with more methylation also had more active amygdalae, and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[this predicted greater increases in depression symptoms a ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“The small, daily challenges of scraping by can build up ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[as deeply as levels of markers on our DNA.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[THE BRIGHT SIDE OF SUSCEPTIBILITY ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Collaborating with scientists across the globe, Belsky has ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[spent years researching “differential susceptibility”—the ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[He has looked at the effect of quality care at orphanages in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Portugal, the link between prenatal stress and attention deficit ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[hyperactivity disorder, and how peer relations influence ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[hyperactivity and impulsivity, just to name a few areas of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[research. And he has found a genetic connection. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[For example, some variations of the serotonin-transporter ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[gene have been linked to depression. And variations of the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[dopamine-receptor gene have been linked to attention deficit ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[hyperactivity disorder. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[But that is not all. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Intriguingly, these supposed ‘risk’ genes also turn out to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[be associated with heightened sensitivity to environmental ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[conditions,” Belsky said. “Children who carry either or both ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of them appear to be most adversely affected by negative ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[experiences, and seem to benefit most from supportive ones.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[And children without them seem relatively immune to the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[effects of both supportive and unsupportive environments. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Some people are more affected by their developmental ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Genetic analyses by graduate student Megan Mayo have ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[One of Hull’s students, Joe Medley, devoted his ]]></paragraph>
