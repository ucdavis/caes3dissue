From the Dean Focus on Breeding, Genetics, and Genomics HUMANS BEGAN EXPERIMENTING with selective breeding thousands of years ago when plants and animals were first domesticated, but it wasn’t until the mid-19th century when Gregor Mendel demonstrated the fundamentals of heredity with scientific experiments on peas that the field of genetics got its start. Today we live in a world where knowledge of the form and function of genes has exploded through many disciplines in the agricultural, environmental, and human sciences. Our college and UC Davis in general are at the forefront of developing new knowledge about genetics and its many related disciplines like genomics and bioinformatics. We need this knowledge now more than ever. The world population is currently estimated to be 7.5 billion— and growing. Society’s challenge is how to sustainably feed this growing world population while maintaining a healthy environment. Breeders of plants and animals need the information created by geneticists and other scientists to develop resilient species that are more productive and less susceptible to diseases, pests, and the uncertainties of a changing climate. Natural resources professionals use genetic knowledge of biodiversity to maintain a healthy environment. Medical professionals understand much more about human health and wellness today as a result of genetics. Our ability to understand DNA, gene expression, and how life manifests in the world has improved markedly with the new tools of recent years. Next-generation sequencing technology and the more robust data-crunching power of today’s computers enable scientists to look at tens of thousands of genetic markers. This empowers researchers to learn more about population genetics in wildlife, pest resistance in crops, or disease pathways in humans. We are committed to leading in the discovery and development of new technologies and new knowledge that will benefit our food and agriculture systems, our communities, and our environment. That necessitates a deep understanding of the basic building blocks of life. This issue of Outlook provides a glimpse into that world and our contribution to the science of genetics. ",

Doing it quickly, working with unfamiliar animals, competing in an arena against other collegians, and making sure no equipment falls off before your mule crosses the finish line—that challenge was met by four UC Davis animal science students who took a first-place win in the 2016 Intercollegiate Packing Competition. The packing competition was one of many contests held during Mule Days, an annual Memorial Day Weekend event in Bishop, California. Students at the Horse Barn, part of the Department of Animal Science, formed the UC Davis packing team only three years ago. They receive support from veterinarian and UC Davis alumnus Craig London of the Rock Creek Pack Station and coaching assistance from Andy Assereto of the Backcountry Horsemen of California Mother Lode Unit. “In the arena, the competition was so fierce, yet come dinnertime, all the competitors would come together and have a great time around the fire,” said senior Kayla Wigney. “We look forward to packing together or against each other in the future.” —Robin DeRieux ",

Traditionally, it is women who tend small backyard flocks. Chickens provide high-protein sustenance for families, as well as income that empowers women and improves their quality of life. Raising indigenous chickens is a relatively minor investment compared to cattle, pigs, or other livestock, since the birds scavenge for food and live outdoors without housing. But rural poultry production in Africa is threatened by the number one avian virus on the continent—Newcastle disease. Newcastle is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can decimate entire flocks in a matter of days. In the United States and other developed countries, the disease is controlled through vaccination. In African countries, various obstacles prevent the Newcastle vaccine from being a feasible means to protect poultry. UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 3 ",

Scientists are more than three years into the five-year Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Genomics to Improve Poultry project, which has $6 million in USAID funding. “There is a genetic component to disease and heat resistance,” said Zhou, who is a UC Davis Chancellor’s Fellow. “We aren’t saying the genetic or genomic approach will replace vaccinations—we’re taking a complementary GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis What is a genome? And what does it mean when scientists say they have sequenced a genome? of the four building blocks that make up an individual organism’s DNA code—represented by the letters A, T, C, and G—is called a DNA sequence. A genome is the entire DNA sequence for an organism. For example, an international team of geneticists sequenced the chicken genome in 2004—they determined the exact order of the letters representing the building blocks, or base pairs, of the organism’s DNA. Chickens, like any organism, are likely to share 99.5 percent of the same base pairs in the same sequence. Because there are approximately 1 billion base pairs in the chicken genome, the 0.5 percent difference translates to nearly half a million genetic variations between any two individuals. THE EXACT ORDER 4 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017 Genes are partial segments of the genome, varied in size, that account for differences in appearance, resilience, and other traits expressed in an organism—collectively called the “phenotype.” In the case of chickens, examples of phenotype include brown feathers, white feathers, good layer, bad layer, muscular chickens, fat chickens. Once an organism’s genome has been sequenced, scientists seek to identify the genes or genetic markers associated with traits of interest. Some traits are determined by a single gene. More often, many genes work together to specify a trait. Most traits are influenced by both genes and the environment. Information gleaned from a sequenced genome helps researchers make breeding decisions for crops or livestock that will more reliably and efficiently produce the desired results. Think of the genome as a book that contains a set of directions to build an organism. Inside the book are sentences—genes that instruct cells how to make proteins that affect various traits. But a genome is no easy book to read. It’s like a stream-of- consciousness opus with no capitalization or punctuation, no clear indication where words end or sentences begin. Strings of extra letters are randomly inserted throughout. Scientists have to discern ",

We want to identify the genetic markers that are associated with resistance and use the natural variation to breed birds that are more resilient.” Another component of the poultry project is to build capacity—renovating facilities and training scientists at Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania and at the University of Ghana so that the work in these countries can continue beyond the initial involvement of American universities. One of the most difficult aspects of the project “Each gene involved tends to contribute a small genetic effect, making them hard to detect.” is that disease and heat resistance are complex traits, which means they are controlled by many genes—perhaps hundreds. “Each gene involved tends to contribute a small genetic effect, making them hard to detect,” said Zhou. “It’s a tremendous challenge.” • EXAMPLES OF GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES GENE EDITING which parts of the book code for genes, what those genes do, and how they interact with other genes to determine individual traits. Add to that, a book containing the entire genome for a species reads pretty much the same for any two individuals. The book is so long that the small differences in wording account for significant differences in outcome. So while sequencing a genome provides scientists with a book of instructions, it’s a book that needs to be decoded in order to be understood. Once researchers can read the story, they have to figure out what the story means. —Robin DeRieux Gene editing uses molecular “scissors” to precisely cut DNA sequences at a particular location in the genome. Think of it as using spellcheck for a gene. By tinkering with the individual letters at a precise location, scientists can introduce a preferred trait, one that already exists as a naturally occurring variation within the species. Gene editing has been used to prevent horn formation in cattle, eliminating the need to remove horns from dairy cows . GENETIC ENGINEERING Genetic engineering is the process of transferring a specific gene from the genome of one organism into another to pass along a desired trait or function. An organism that has been genetically engineered is called a Genetically Modified Organism, or GMO. This term can be confusing because traditional selective breeding also modifies a species—like domestic dogs and their ancestor, the wolf. Genetically engineered offspring can also be called “transgenic.” Genetic engineering was used to create a papaya variety resistant to ringspot disease by introducing DNA from the virus, which essentially vaccinated the fruit against the virus. Genetic engineering was used because papaya contains no naturally occurring genetic resistance to the virus. UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 5 ",

                "data": "how we respond to stress. Science shows that some people are more genetically predisposed than others to develop depression and anxiety in response to stressful situations. What’s more, researchers say that chronic exposure to stressful conditions—such as poverty, family discord, and poor nutrition—can alter the way genes behave in children and adolescents, making them more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and other negative effects of stress. But mounting evidence from scientists with the UC Davis Department of Human Ecology suggests there is also an upside to the link between genetics and environmental exposure. In many cases, the same people who are most adversely affected by negative experiences also benefit the most from supportive and even benign environments. “It’s not just that some individuals are more ‘vulnerable’ to adversity, but rather that some people are more developmentally malleable for better and for worse,” explained Jay Belsky, professor of human development. “Many of the genes long thought to operate as a risk factor for problem behavior when things go poorly may also be an opportunity factor when children are exposed to interventions and when things go well.” Belsky and his colleague, human development professor Johnna Swartz, are uncovering intriguing clues about the connection between genetics, stress, and opportunity that could change the way society views, treats, and prevents depression, anxiety, and other disorders. OUR GENES CAN INFLUENCE FIGHT OR FLIGHT Swartz and others have discovered that measures of brain function, which are influenced by genetic variation, may predict later psychiatric conditions. Working with Professor Ahmad Hariri at Duke University, Swartz analyzed the brain scans of 340 college students while they were looking at images of angry or fearful faces. Swartz and colleagues measured activity in the students’ amygdala—the tiny emotion-processing center of the brain—to see how active it was in response to the threatening stimuli. After the measurements were taken, the students answered questions assessing stress in their lives, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. Students with more reactive amygdalae at the start of the study—more exaggerated fight-or-flight responses to the scared and angry faces— experienced more severe symptoms in response to later stressful situations in their lives. “By identifying genetic markers that predict these patterns of brain function, we could potentially guide people at higher risk for depression and anxiety to seek preventative treatment before symptoms become chronic and disruptive in their lives,” Swartz said. With further research, genetics could also help doctors identify the imbalance or pathway causing a patient’s disorder and more precisely treat the problem. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Both nature and nurture seem to play a role in how people process stressful experiences. New research from Swartz and Professor Douglas Williamson at Duke University links poverty to changes in gene expression. Their study followed 183 children ages 11 to 15 over three years, testing them for symptoms of depression and scanning their brain activity in response to photos of fearful faces. During the course of the study, children from more disadvantaged families had greater methylation—a process that can change the way genes behave—of a gene that controls levels of serotonin, which can affect a person’s mood. Children with more methylation also had more active amygdalae, and this predicted greater increases in depression symptoms a year later. “The small, daily challenges of scraping by can build up and affect children’s development,” Swartz said. “It shows that our biology is not set in stone, and environments can affect us as deeply as levels of markers on our DNA.” THE BRIGHT SIDE OF SUSCEPTIBILITY Collaborating with scientists across the globe, Belsky has spent years researching “differential susceptibility”—the concept that some children are more likely to suffer in bad settings and flourish in good ones due to their genetic makeup. He has looked at the effect of quality care at orphanages in Portugal, the link between prenatal stress and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and how peer relations influence hyperactivity and impulsivity, just to name a few areas of research. And he has found a genetic connection. For example, some variations of the serotonin-transporter gene have been linked to depression. And variations of the dopamine-receptor gene have been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But that is not all. “Intriguingly, these supposed ‘risk’ genes also turn out to be associated with heightened sensitivity to environmental conditions,” Belsky said. “Children who carry either or both of them appear to be most adversely affected by negative experiences, and seem to benefit most from supportive ones.” And children without them seem relatively immune to the effects of both supportive and unsupportive environments. “Some people are more affected by their developmental experiences than others,” Belsky said. “I think of it more as diversity rather than damage. Genetics can inform our understanding of human development and help us find ways for all of us to thrive.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 7 ",

                "data": "Variable weather is creating extreme challenges for crop breeding in California. that will thrive under certain conditions when you can no longer predict what those conditions will be? “It’s the question we’re all asking,” said Charlie Brummer, professor and director of the UC Davis Plant Breeding Center. “Our weather patterns are changing so fast, affecting everything from soil composition to what to expect in terms of weeds, diseases, and pests. It can take 10 years to develop a new crop variety, even more for perennial plants. So we have to extrapolate what the future will bring—very, very quickly.” Changes have already begun, according to Allen Van Deynze, director of research at the UC Davis Seed Biotechnology Center. A spike in insects and the viruses they transmit are threatening vegetable crops in California and beyond. “An extra four-to-six weeks of heat can produce another generation of aphids and wipe out an entire crop,” Van Deynze explained. “The insects are multiplying very fast.” Extreme variations in localized weather pose a bigger challenge to breeders than long- term climate shift. If you know weather will trend hotter, you can plan for that. It is the wild swings—the longer droughts and more intense floodings—that are tricky. “The insects, weeds, and other pests that thrive in more humid settings are different from those you find during drought,” Brummer said. “We’re working to breed crops that can adapt to it all.” HOW DO YOU DEVELOP CROPS Breeders and engineers at UC Davis are helping crops keep pace with variable weather by using advanced genetic strategies, developing robotic sensors to measure plant performance, and training the next generation of plant breeders. Time-lapse evolution UC Davis breeders help develop new cultivars, or varieties, of the nearly 400 fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and ornamentals grown year-round in California’s diverse environments. To create a winning variety, breeders cross plants with desired traits and select the best offspring over multiple generations. That is essentially how humans have been improving crops since the dawn of agriculture 10,000 years ago. But breeding has become faster and smarter, thanks to rapid improvements in DNA sequencing and the computer power to analyze a wealth of genetic data. Some plant traits, such as flavor and size, are determined by many genes acting together. Other traits, such as resistance to a disease, may be regulated by a single gene. Breeders can now identify genes that influence some traits at the molecular level, so they can select plants at the seed or seedling stage based on their DNA sequence rather than wait for traits to express themselves as the plants mature. That speeds up the process. “We have the tools to respond quickly to BREEDING for 8 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017 ",

Breeders also need to phenotype, which is to measure traits as plants grow in the field. “Molecular tools help us find genes of interest for some traits, but you don’t really know what you have for other traits until you make your crosses and grow plants in the field,” Brummer explained. “While trying to solve one problem, you David Slaughter has developed a tractor-pulled phenotyping system (left) that creates can’t inadvertently forget about yield or virtual models of each plant as it grows in the field.

                "data": "BREEDING HILL-CLIMBING COWS BY DIANE NELSON MOST OF THE 5 MILLION CATTLE THAT GRAZE on California’s rangelands like to dine in the valleys and hang out by creeks. This can lead to overgrazing in riparian areas and let perfectly good forage on hillsides go to waste. But some cows are different. They prefer to climb hills and mountains and eat along the way. If more cattle followed the road less traveled, rangelands would be more productive and sustainable throughout California and the West. That is why a team of researchers, including UC Davis animal geneticist Juan Medrano, is working to develop an easy, inexpensive genetic test to help ranchers improve cattle distribution by breeding hill-climbing cows. “It’s very exciting research,” said Medrano, a professor with the Department of Animal Science who is collaborating with scientists throughout the West. “DNA technology makes it relatively easy to test and breed for production traits like milk yield and growth rate. But it’s brand new to identify genetic markers linked to animal behavior. This could have a huge impact on food security and rangeland management.” NATURE AND NURTURE One third of California—38 million acres—is rangeland. Most of it is mountainous or hilly and managed for livestock production. Grazing on rangeland feeds livestock, but also offers many 10 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017 environmental benefits such as keeping weeds and other invasive species in check, providing water storage and carbon sequestration, and supporting habitat for animals and plants found nowhere else in the world. Problems arise, though, when rangeland is overgrazed and cattle spend too much time near running water, where manure and calving can create water-quality risks for people downstream. That is especially true in California. Some 80 percent of the state’s drinking and irrigation water is stored on or passes through rangeland. Researchers at UC Davis and beyond have been working for decades with ranchers to keep cattle from overgrazing and congregating by creeks. They build strategic fencing, for example, and provide water and salt licks on ridgetops away from running water. Cowhands often herd cattle from low-lying pastures, but that is labor-intensive and only a temporary fix. A few years ago, Derek Bailey, a professor of range science at New Mexico State University and a colleague of Medrano, had an intriguing thought: What if we combine nature and nurture? “I’ve been watching cattle for years, and there are always some cows that just take off for the hills, like they didn’t know they weren’t elk,” Bailey said. “They could be belly-deep in green grass, and just bolt for the hills. They like it up there. We can breed for other traits. Why not ",

Photo courtesy of Derek Bailey, New Mexico State University select for hill climbing?” Bailey joined forces with Medrano and a team of researchers, including animal genetics expert Milton Thomas at Colorado State University. Funded by a grant from Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, the group is close to developing a genetic test for whether a bull is likely to sire daughters who like to climb hills. LOCOMOTION, MOTIVATION, AND SPATIAL LEARNING To identify hill-climbing cattle, Bailey and his crew put GPS collars on 180 cows on seven ranches in three western states and took measurements every 10 minutes for months at a time. They tracked the cattle’s slope use, elevation gain, and distance traveled from water. They also took blood samples that Medrano and his team analyzed for chromosomal commonalities. Medrano found overlap in genes linked to locomotion, motivation, and spatial learning. “Results so far are very encouraging,” Medrano said. “Soon we will be able to test and breed for hill-climbing behavior.” Breeding for one trait can sometimes produce unintended consequences like predisposition to disease or low calf weight. Researchers are looking closely at that possibility, and have so far found no correlation between hill-climbing behavior and undesired traits. “We’ve looked at calf-weaning weights, pregnancy rates, blood pressure, even disposition,” Bailey said. “We had one theory that hill-climbing cows tended toward the meaner end of the scale, but that’s not the case. “Some cows just prefer to climb more than other cows,” Bailey continued. “And if breeding can move the bell curve in that direction, “I’VE BEEN WATCHING CATTLE FOR YEARS, AND THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME COWS THAT JUST TAKE OFF FOR THE HILLS, LIKE THEY DIDN’T KNOW THEY WEREN’T ELK.” management tools like fencing and herding will be much more effective.” California ranchers are intrigued by the possibility. “I can see many ecological and economic benefits to breeding for cows who like to travel,” said Clayton Koopmann, a rancher and rangeland-management consultant who runs cattle on hilly ground throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. “Forage would be consumed more evenly, and that’s good for livestock production and for the environment.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 11 ",

Hull’s group is interested in finding out which populations are being monitored by GGRO. Graduate student Breanna Martinico is analyzing Cooper’s hawk DNA from the Marin Headlands and from other locations around the country. “Are we monitoring a local population of California birds or are we monitoring a population migrating from someplace else?” Hull asks. “That’s important because if we see a decline, where should we look for the problem? We’ve seen this in red- tailed hawks with two distinct populations that fly through the Marin Headlands—one from California and one from the northern Intermountain West.” The Harlan’s hawk is categorized as a subspecies of red- tailed hawk, but some people believe it is a separate species. “There’s a lot of debate about this because there’s a lot of variation in the birds’ plumage,” Hull said. “Each individual looks different from the next to a much greater extent than any other raptor species that we work with.” Genetic analyses by graduate student Megan Mayo have shown, however, that the Harlan’s hawk and red-tailed hawk are the same species. “We’re confident that they’re not a different species and we’re confident that they are interbreeding, so that leaves some other ecological factor that is causing this variation to persist,” Hull said. Raptors are birds of prey such as hawks and falcons that provide a number of important environmental benefits. Some raptors—barn owls, for instance—keep rodent populations in check. Raptors can indicate the presence of environmental contaminants. Many years ago, scientists established a connection between DDT and the decline of bald eagles, peregrines, and ospreys. Since that pesticide was banned in 1972, these species have recovered. “Raptors signal a healthy ecosystem” said Josh Hull, an adjunct professor in the Department of Animal Science. “They are also a good indicator of species diversity.” Hull studies raptors with a team of graduate students and colleagues at UC Davis. They are using genetic tools to understand more about individuals in a population, the relationships among different populations, and the prey species that are important to survival. With the advent of next- generation sequencing technology, more powerful computers, and good old-fashioned field work, Hull’s team is gaining new insight into these magnificent birds to assist wildlife managers in conservation efforts. For instance, Yosemite National Park has a genetically distinct population of great gray owls—a “charismatic” species that is a high priority for park managers. “They’re an isolated population that appears to have been on its own for many thousands of years,” Hull said. “They appear to be very rare, but we don’t have a good sense of how this population is doing.” One of Hull’s students, Joe Medley, devoted his graduate work to collecting molted feathers from known nesting areas in the park’s high country. From those samples, DNA has been extracted and genetic markers called microsatellites were used to identify individual owls and get a better sense of population status. The sharp-shinned hawk is the smallest hawk in North America. Working with Golden Gate Raptor Observatory (GGRO) scientists, graduate student Ryan Bourbour has collected DNA samples with a swab from the birds’ beaks to learn what these hawks are eating while migrating. “People are always asking, ‘What do hawks eat?’” Hull said. “Beyond that, from a Ecology Graduate Group Ph.D. student Megan conservation perspective, this is going to help Mayo has been studying population variation us understand what these birds need.” in tundra-breeding, rough-legged hawks, which Work is now underway to sequence migrate as far as California in the winter.

Evans’ updated edition of The Davis Farmers Market Cookbook. Ingredient explores eight basic elements found in every culinary creation—water, sugars, carbs, lipids, proteins, minerals, gases, and heat. “It’s a book designed for anyone who wants to understand the world of food a little bit better,” said Bouzari (Ph.D., ’15 food science). “The idea that I could write something applicable to a paleo-nutritionist, a chef in a fine dining restaurant, and my grandmother cooking food for Thanksgiving was really intriguing to me.” The Davis Farmers Market Cookbook features 75 seasonal recipes. “Eating what’s in season makes a difference in price and in flavor,” said Evans (B.S., ’75 consumer food science). “You lose your connection with nature when you don’t see and feel the seasons.” A portion of the proceeds from her book sales will support the CA&ES Dean’s Circle Scholarship Fund, a program that provides essential support to students within the college.

KARIN HIGGINS/UC Davis Homegrown experts help restore the Arboretum Waterway in its mission to clean and beautify the Arboretum Waterway: homegrown expertise. An expanding group of undergraduate students—led by Randy Dahlgren, a professor and world leader in water-quality biogeochemistry—will sample the water and provide important analysis throughout the university’s multiyear effort to enhance the waterway. The students are part of a new group internship Dahlgren designed to provide undergraduates hands-on experience in water-quality and aquatic-ecosystem restoration. “It’s good for everyone,” Dahlgren said. “The students are playing a critical role in solving real-world problems, which gives restoration efforts a better chance to succeed and benefits all of us who enjoy the centerpiece of the Arboretum.” Visitors love walking the 3.5-mile loop around the Arboretum Waterway—except when the water is covered with unsightly duckweed and algae, a natural byproduct of what is essentially a stagnant pond. The waterway sits in the channel that used to be the North Fork of Putah Creek, but long ago the creek was diverted due to frequent flooding. Now, the waterway is dammed at both ends and serves as a holding pond for storm runoff and a receptacle for clean, recycled wastewater. UC Davis recently launched a four-year project to reduce algae growth and sedimentation by increasing water flow, UC DAVIS HAS A SECRET WEAPON deepening and narrowing the channel, and planting more native wetland vegetation on the banks. “We’re introducing small elevation gains and a pump to recirculate the water,” said Andrew Fulks, assistant director of the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Gardens. “Picture a series of large, natural steps with water cascading down.” HOW MONITORING WATER QUALITY HELPS Water quality is not a toggle switch, not something you switch on and off. “It’s like cholesterol in our blood,” Dahlgren explained. “When your cholesterol is too high, you take progressive steps to lower it. Maybe first you increase exercise, then change your diet, then turn to statin drugs if the other two steps aren’t effective.” But you don’t know whether interventions are working if you don’t monitor the blood or, in this case, the water. Throughout the restoration project, Dahlgren and his students will measure water-quality indicators such as levels of nitrogen, phosphorous, dissolved oxygen, and algae. The group internship got underway last fall with 10 undergraduates majoring in Environmental Science and Management. “It was a lot of fun,” said Samuel Moose, a member of the inaugural group. “I really enjoyed the fieldwork and the opportunity to solve problems.” “And we got to see the big picture,” added Anna Britzman, who plans to pursue a career in wildlife conservation. “We worked with so many experts, and it helped me see how important water quality is to restoring wildlife habitat.” —Diane Nelson UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 17 ",

Fortunately, that didn’t happen. “My doctors found something that was relatively minor,” she said. “It was a huge relief.” DESTINEE COOPER (’04 ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY) is paying it forward by paying it back. As a youth, she knew she wanted to help others. Bright and ambitious, she had her sights set on college—the first in her family to dream that big. She applied to and was accepted at four UC campuses. She chose UC Davis. “I knew I would be going through a huge transition because my family was moving to Montana,” the Modesto native said. “Davis reminded me of home. It was a place I felt comfortable with, and I felt like I’d be supported. Right from the get-go, it was a good fit.” Her instincts were right. She discovered an interest in environmental toxicology and found department faculty and staff who readily offered their support—academically and through an especially challenging time. During her senior Courtesy photo “I never forgot the fact that I was helped in this manner.” Destinee worked hard at her studies and always held several jobs—as a math and chemistry tutor and as an undergraduate research assistant in a molecular biology lab studying yeast, a Superfund lab investigating arsenic, and for the Department of Viticulture and Enology working with grapes. Destinee and her family did not have the resources to pay for her education at UC Davis. “Once I got in, I wondered, ‘How am I going to finance this? How do I support myself through this process? Scholarships were the number one thing.’” Destinee was the recipient of the Henry Jastro Scholarship and the Henry W. Seale Scholarship. These scholarships were established in the early years of the college by the families of California ranchers, Jastro and Seale, to support students. “Those programs not only supported my academic career, they also gave me the money to do research and to support me financially.” A Native American of Crow descent, Destinee is now in a satisfying career helping Native American tribes in California and Arizona build the capacity to address environmental needs. And she is making regular contributions to the very scholarships that made her education possible. “I never forgot the fact that I was helped in this manner,” she said. “I can make the sacrifices to give back financially and to fulfill a promise I made when I signed my scholarship agreements. I had an awesome time at UC Davis, and I am definitely grateful for everything I was able to do while I was there.

The gift establishes an endowment to fund a full-time staff brewing position in the Department of Food Science and Technology. The new Sierra Nevada Brewing Company Endowed Brewer position is dedicated to mentoring and managing students and teaching assistants, maintaining and operating the campus brewery and its equipment, and assisting in teaching brewing classes. “This Endowed Brewer position allows us to provide outstanding practical brewing experiences for our students as we continue to align hands-on training with the best theoretical education,” said Charlie Bamforth, the Anheuser-Busch Endowed Professor of Malting and Brewing Sciences. “Students don’t get that combination in most other brewing programs.” Teaching and research in brewing science has been an integral part of UC Davis since 1958. Undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with a solid scientific grounding and afford opportunities to learn core brewing and business skills. “My family and I have supported the brewing program at UC Davis for nearly two decades,” said Grossman, Sierra Nevada’s founder. “Charlie Bamforth is not only an expert in brewing science, technology, and engineering, but a frequent guest speaker at our brewery and a close, personal friend. The ideals that he and the rest of the staff instill in the students are the very same principles that have guided our success in craft brewing for the past 36 years.” Founded in 1980, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is one of America’s premier brewing companies, highly regarded for using only the finest quality ingredients. The company is widely known for its brewhouse innovations and commitment to sustainability. “Over the years, Ken has been incredibly good to UC Davis,” said Bamforth, noting that Grossman generously shares his expertise in commercial brewing with students. For many years he lectured every quarter in the Introduction to Beer and Brewing course and often hosts Bamforth and his students for tours of the Sierra Nevada brewery in Chico. “Our students have learned from Ken the true meaning of quality,” Bamforth said. “Everything at Sierra Nevada speaks quality, from the brewing itself to the company’s insistence on sustainable approaches to the process. Sierra Nevada is the ultimate in brewing excellence, and it is marvelous that Ken and Katie have demonstrated their commitment to UC Davis, where our mantra also is about doing things the right way.” —Patricia Bailey, UC Davis News and Media Relations UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 23 ",

DeShon and her “Mussel Dogs” contract with several lakes and reservoirs in California to inspect incoming boats to make sure no tiny, invasive mussels have hitchhiked a ride. “Mussel Dogs have given us a significant technological breakthrough in the difficult fight against zebra and quagga mussels,” said Scott Cameron, president of the national Reduce Risks from Invasive Species Coalition, which recently honored DeShon for her work. “They do it by tapping into one of the most sensitive detection OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017 Invasive-mussel inspections are not mandatory at most lakes and reservoirs in California. But more waterway managers are investing in preventative inspections because the Department of Motor Vehicles has made funding available, and the cost of coping with a mussel invasion is so high. Humans can protect against mussels by taking about 20 minutes per boat to hose the hull with scalding, hot water. It takes dogs about two minutes to check for mussels. “Popeye and our other Mussel Dogs—Noah, Nemo, Captain, and Sinbad—can inspect about 110 boats a day,” DeShon said from her home outside Turlock. DeShon trains dogs for a variety of missions, such as sniffing out a form of yeast in wineries that can taint the flavor of wine, detecting bed bugs, and providing companionship to veterans coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. She works with the Green Dog Rescue Project based in Windsor, California, where she helps dogs find their true calling in life. “We got Nemo from someone who couldn’t keep him anymore,” DeShon said. “He was barking and driving the neighbors crazy.

Lysozyme is an enzyme naturally found in human breast milk. The enzyme has antibacterial properties that help protect babies against diarrhea and promotes growth of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. The researchers introduced the human gene into the goat genome to produce higher levels of lysozyme in goats’ milk.
