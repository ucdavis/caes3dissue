BREEDING
<br>
HILL-CLIMBING COWS
<br>
BY DIANE NELSON
<br>
MOST OF THE 5 MILLION CATTLE THAT GRAZE
<br>
on California’s rangelands like to dine in the
<br>
valleys and hang out by creeks. This can lead to
<br>
overgrazing in riparian areas and let perfectly
<br>
good forage on hillsides go to waste.
<br>
<br>
But some cows are different. They prefer to
<br>
climb hills and mountains and eat along the way.
<br>
<br>
If more cattle followed the road less traveled,
<br>
rangelands would be more productive and
<br>
sustainable throughout California and the West.
<br>
<br>
That is why a team of researchers, including
<br>
UC Davis animal geneticist Juan Medrano, is
<br>
working to develop an easy, inexpensive genetic
<br>
test to help ranchers improve cattle distribution
<br>
by breeding hill-climbing cows.
<br>
<br>
“It’s very exciting research,” said Medrano, a
<br>
professor with the Department of Animal Science
<br>
who is collaborating with scientists throughout
<br>
the West. “DNA technology makes it relatively
<br>
easy to test and breed for production traits like
<br>
milk yield and growth rate. But it’s brand new
<br>
to identify genetic markers linked to animal
<br>
behavior. This could have a huge impact on
<br>
food security and rangeland management.”
<br>
NATURE AND NURTURE
<br>
One third of California—38 million acres—is
<br>
rangeland. Most of it is mountainous or hilly and
<br>
managed for livestock production. Grazing on
<br>
rangeland feeds livestock, but also offers many
<br>

<br>
environmental benefits such as keeping weeds
<br>
and other invasive species in check, providing
<br>
water storage and carbon sequestration, and
<br>
supporting habitat for animals and plants found
<br>
nowhere else in the world.
<br>
<br>
Problems arise, though, when rangeland is
<br>
overgrazed and cattle spend too much time near
<br>
running water, where manure and calving can
<br>
create water-quality risks for people downstream.
<br>
<br>
That is especially true in California. Some
<br>
80 percent of the state’s drinking and irrigation
<br>
water is stored on or passes through rangeland.
<br>
<br>
Researchers at UC Davis and beyond have
<br>
been working for decades with ranchers to keep
<br>
cattle from overgrazing and congregating by
<br>
creeks. They build strategic fencing, for example,
<br>
and provide water and salt licks on ridgetops
<br>
away from running water. Cowhands often herd
<br>
cattle from low-lying pastures, but that is
<br>
labor-intensive and only a temporary fix.
<br>
<br>
A few years ago, Derek Bailey, a professor of
<br>
range science at New Mexico State University
<br>
and a colleague of Medrano, had an intriguing
<br>
thought: What if we combine nature and nurture?
<br>
“I’ve been watching cattle for years, and there
<br>
are always some cows that just take off for the
<br>
hills, like they didn’t know they weren’t elk,”
<br>
Bailey said. “They could be belly-deep in green
<br>
grass, and just bolt for the hills. They like it up
<br>
there. We can breed for other traits. Why not
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Using GPS collars,
<br>
researchers tracked which
<br>
cattle spent most of their time
<br>
in the valleys and which cattle
<br>
grazed along steep slopes.
<br>
<br>
This image shows the grazing
<br>
pattern of two young heifers
<br>
tracked on a ranch in New
<br>
Mexico. The turquoise-dot
<br>
heifer roamed the hillsides,
<br>
while the pink-dot heifer
<br>
primarily grazed gentle terrain.

select for hill climbing?”
<br>
Bailey joined forces with Medrano and a team
<br>
of researchers, including animal genetics expert
<br>
Milton Thomas at Colorado State University.
<br>
<br>
Funded by a grant from Western Sustainable
<br>
Agriculture Research and Education, the group is
<br>
close to developing a genetic test for whether a bull
<br>
is likely to sire daughters who like to climb hills.
<br>
<br>
LOCOMOTION, MOTIVATION, AND
<br>
SPATIAL LEARNING
<br>
To identify hill-climbing cattle, Bailey
<br>
and his crew put GPS collars on 180 cows on
<br>
seven ranches in three western states and took
<br>
measurements every 10 minutes for months at a
<br>
time. They tracked the cattle’s slope use, elevation
<br>
gain, and distance traveled from water. They
<br>
also took blood samples that Medrano and his
<br>
team analyzed for chromosomal commonalities.
<br>
<br>
Medrano found overlap in genes linked to
<br>
locomotion, motivation, and spatial learning.
<br>
<br>
“Results so far are very encouraging,”
<br>
Medrano said. “Soon we will be able to test and
<br>
breed for hill-climbing behavior.”
<br>
Breeding for one trait can sometimes produce
<br>
unintended consequences like predisposition
<br>
to disease or low calf weight. Researchers are
<br>
looking closely at that possibility, and have so
<br>
far found no correlation between hill-climbing
<br>
behavior and undesired traits.
<br>
<br>
“We’ve looked at calf-weaning weights,
<br>
pregnancy rates, blood pressure, even
<br>
disposition,” Bailey said. “We had one theory
<br>
that hill-climbing cows tended toward the
<br>
meaner end of the scale, but that’s not the case.
<br>
<br>
“Some cows just prefer to climb more than
<br>
other cows,” Bailey continued. “And if breeding
<br>
can move the bell curve in that direction,
<br>
“I’VE BEEN WATCHING CATTLE FOR YEARS,
<br>
AND THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME COWS THAT
<br>
JUST TAKE OFF FOR THE HILLS, LIKE THEY
<br>
DIDN’T KNOW THEY WEREN’T ELK.”
<br>
management tools like fencing and herding
<br>
will be much more effective.”
<br>
California ranchers are intrigued by the
<br>
possibility. “I can see many ecological and economic
<br>
benefits to breeding for cows who like to
<br>
travel,” said Clayton Koopmann, a rancher
<br>
and rangeland-management consultant who
<br>
runs cattle on hilly ground throughout the San
<br>
Francisco Bay Area. “Forage would be consumed
<br>
more evenly, and that’s good for livestock
<br>
production and for the environment.”
