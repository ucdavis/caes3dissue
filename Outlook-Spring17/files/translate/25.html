Sierra Nevada Brewing owners establish endowment for UC Davis brewing program
<br>
IN LATE 2016, KEN GROSSMAN OF SIERRA NEVADA BREWING CO .
<br>
<br>
and his wife, Katie Gonser, presented UC Davis with
<br>
a $2 million gift to support our renowned brewing
<br>
science program.
<br>
<br>
The gift establishes an endowment to fund a full-time
<br>
staff brewing position in the Department of Food Science
<br>
and Technology. The new Sierra Nevada Brewing Company
<br>
Endowed Brewer position is dedicated to mentoring and
<br>
managing students and teaching assistants, maintaining
<br>
and operating the campus brewery and its equipment, and
<br>
assisting in teaching brewing classes.
<br>
<br>
“This Endowed Brewer position allows us to provide
<br>
outstanding practical brewing experiences for our students as
<br>
we continue to align hands-on training with the best theoretical
<br>
education,” said Charlie Bamforth, the Anheuser-Busch
<br>
Endowed Professor of Malting and Brewing Sciences. “Students
<br>
don’t get that combination in most other brewing programs.”
<br>
Teaching and research in brewing science has been an
<br>
integral part of UC Davis since 1958. Undergraduate and
<br>
graduate programs provide students with a solid scientific
<br>
grounding and afford opportunities to learn core brewing
<br>
and business skills.
<br>
<br>
“My family and I have supported the brewing program
<br>
at UC Davis for nearly two decades,” said Grossman, Sierra
<br>
Nevada’s founder. “Charlie Bamforth is not only an expert in
<br>
brewing science, technology, and engineering, but a frequent
<br>
guest speaker at our brewery and a close, personal friend.
<br>
<br>
The ideals that he and the rest of the staff instill in the
<br>
students are the very same principles that have guided
<br>
our success in craft brewing for the past 36 years.”
<br>
Founded in 1980, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is one of
<br>
America’s premier brewing companies, highly regarded for
<br>
using only the finest quality ingredients. The company is
<br>
widely known for its brewhouse innovations and commitment
<br>
to sustainability.
<br>
<br>
“Over the years, Ken has been incredibly good to UC Davis,”
<br>
said Bamforth, noting that Grossman generously shares his
<br>
expertise in commercial brewing with students. For many
<br>
years he lectured every quarter in the Introduction to Beer and
<br>
Brewing course and often hosts Bamforth and his students for
<br>
tours of the Sierra Nevada brewery in Chico.
<br>
<br>
“Our students have learned from Ken the true meaning of
<br>
quality,” Bamforth said. “Everything at Sierra Nevada speaks
<br>
quality, from the brewing itself to the company’s insistence
<br>
on sustainable approaches to the process. Sierra Nevada is the
<br>
ultimate in brewing excellence, and it is marvelous that Ken
<br>
and Katie have demonstrated their commitment to UC Davis,
<br>
where our mantra also is about doing things the right way.”
