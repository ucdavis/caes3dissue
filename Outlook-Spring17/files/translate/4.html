UC Davis embodies a long tradition of

scientists advancing the knowledge
<br>
of honey bees, and entomology
<br>
professor Brian Johnson has joined
<br>
that tradition through his study of
<br>
honey-bee genetics, evolution, and
<br>
behavior. Johnson is exploring new
<br>
areas in honey-bee genetics.

<br>
Packing a mule requires skill. Doing it quickly, working with
<br>
unfamiliar animals, competing in an arena against other
<br>
collegians, and making sure no equipment falls off before
<br>
your mule crosses the finish line—that challenge was met by
<br>
four UC Davis animal science students who took a first-place
<br>
win in the 2016 Intercollegiate Packing Competition. The
<br>
packing competition was one of many contests held during
<br>
Mule Days, an annual Memorial Day Weekend event
<br>
in Bishop, California.
<br>
<br>
Students at the Horse Barn, part of the Department of
<br>
Animal Science, formed the UC Davis packing team only
<br>
three years ago. They receive support from veterinarian and
<br>
UC Davis alumnus Craig London of the Rock Creek Pack
<br>
Station and coaching assistance from Andy Assereto of the
<br>
Backcountry Horsemen of California Mother Lode Unit.
<br>
<br>
“In the arena, the competition was so fierce, yet come
<br>
dinnertime, all the competitors would come together and have a
<br>
great time around the fire,” said senior Kayla Wigney. “We look
<br>
forward to packing together or against each other in the future.”
