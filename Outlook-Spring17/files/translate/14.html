A CLOSER LOOK
<br>
Inside View
<br>
During winter break, a dozen students from the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences got an insider’s view of agriculture while on
<br>
a three-day tour of farms, nurseries, and related operations in Southern
<br>
California and Arizona. UC Davis undergraduates joined students majoring in
<br>
science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from other universities
<br>
on a trip organized by the Western Growers Association. The tour covered
<br>
automation, irrigation, labor, food safety, and more. While on the tour, students
<br>
connected with professionals in the agriculture industry and learned about the
<br>
many career opportunities available in the field. View additional photos at
