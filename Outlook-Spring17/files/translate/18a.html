What’s Cookin’ in
<br>
CA&ES? Fresh Rag Pasta with Peas and
<br>
Asparagus adopted from The
<br>
Davis Farmers Market Cookbook
<br>
by Ann M. Evans
<br>
A passion for food
<br>
and a love of science is
<br>
apparent in two recent
<br>
books written by CA&ES alumni—Ali Bouzari’s Ingredient: Unveiling
<br>
the Essential Elements of Food, and Ann M. Evans’ updated edition of The
<br>
Davis Farmers Market Cookbook.
<br>
<br>
Ingredient explores eight basic elements found in every culinary
<br>
creation—water, sugars, carbs, lipids, proteins, minerals, gases, and heat.
<br>
<br>
“It’s a book designed for anyone who wants to understand the world of
<br>
food a little bit better,” said Bouzari (Ph.D., ’15 food science). “The idea
<br>
that I could write something applicable to a paleo-nutritionist, a chef
<br>
in a fine dining restaurant, and my grandmother cooking food for
<br>
Thanksgiving was really intriguing to me.”
<br>
The Davis Farmers Market Cookbook features 75 seasonal recipes.
<br>
<br>
“Eating what’s in season makes a difference in price and in flavor,”
<br>
said Evans (B.S., ’75 consumer food science). “You lose your connection
<br>
with nature when you don’t see and feel the seasons.” A portion of the
<br>
proceeds from her book sales will support the CA&ES Dean’s Circle
<br>
Scholarship Fund, a program that provides essential support to students
<br>
within the college.
<br>
<br>
Spice up your library with these two first-rate books from our food
<br>
science alumni who know a thing or two about good food, how to
<br>
prepare it, and the science behind it all. Both books are available in
<br>
regional stores, and online at ucdavisstores.com. Evans’ book is also
<br>
available at the Davis Farmers Market. —Charleen Floyd

Quality olive oil starts with freshly picked olives
<br>
rushed to the mill for pressing. In fall, UC Davis
<br>
students got a taste of the effort involved in harvest
<br>
by hand-gathering fruit from olive trees at campus
<br>
research groves.
<br>
<br>
“I’m amazed at the sheer number of olives it
<br>
takes to produce a small amount of olive oil,” said
<br>
Lauren Crawford, a food science graduate student
<br>
who helped with the harvest. Crawford’s research
<br>
at the UC Davis Olive Center lab focuses on
<br>
developing an enzymatic debittering process for
<br>

<br>
table olives, one that doesn’t produce toxic
<br>
waste water like traditional lye-based methods.
<br>
<br>
The fruits of the harvest are available at
<br>
UC Davis Stores, and online at ucdavisstores.com.
<br>
<br>
You can purchase UC Davis Olive Oil or try the
<br>
Olive Center’s newest product, Premium Dipping
<br>
Oil (shown left), which is a blend of extra virgin
<br>
olive oil from campus groves with balsamic vinegar
<br>
from Modena, Italy, along with garlic, herbs, and
<br>
spices. — Robin DeRieux

THE STUDENT STORY
<br>
Andrew Fulks, assistant director of the UC Davis Arboretum and
<br>
Public Gardens, provides an update on the Arboretum Waterway
<br>
project to students who are helping with restoration efforts.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Homegrown experts
<br>
help restore the
<br>
Arboretum Waterway
<br>
in its mission to clean and
<br>
beautify the Arboretum Waterway: homegrown expertise.
<br>
<br>
An expanding group of undergraduate students—led by
<br>
Randy Dahlgren, a professor and world leader in
<br>
water-quality biogeochemistry—will sample the water and
<br>
provide important analysis throughout the university’s
<br>
multiyear effort to enhance the waterway. The students are
<br>
part of a new group internship Dahlgren designed to provide
<br>
undergraduates hands-on experience in water-quality and
<br>
aquatic-ecosystem restoration.
<br>
<br>
“It’s good for everyone,” Dahlgren said. “The students are
<br>
playing a critical role in solving real-world problems, which
<br>
gives restoration efforts a better chance to succeed and benefits
<br>
all of us who enjoy the centerpiece of the Arboretum.”
<br>
Visitors love walking the 3.5-mile loop around the
<br>
Arboretum Waterway—except when the water is covered with
<br>
unsightly duckweed and algae, a natural byproduct of what is
<br>
essentially a stagnant pond.
<br>
<br>
The waterway sits in the channel that used to be the North
<br>
Fork of Putah Creek, but long ago the creek was diverted due
<br>
to frequent flooding. Now, the waterway is dammed at both
<br>
ends and serves as a holding pond for storm runoff and a
<br>
receptacle for clean, recycled wastewater.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis recently launched a four-year project to reduce
<br>
algae growth and sedimentation by increasing water flow,
<br>
UC DAVIS HAS A SECRET WEAPON
<br>
deepening and narrowing the channel, and planting more
<br>
native wetland vegetation on the banks.
<br>
<br>
“We’re introducing small elevation gains and a pump to
<br>
recirculate the water,” said Andrew Fulks, assistant director of
<br>
the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Gardens. “Picture a series
<br>
of large, natural steps with water cascading down.”
<br>
HOW MONITORING WATER QUALITY HELPS
<br>
Water quality is not a toggle switch, not something you
<br>
switch on and off.
<br>
<br>
“It’s like cholesterol in our blood,” Dahlgren explained.
<br>
<br>
“When your cholesterol is too high, you take progressive
<br>
steps to lower it. Maybe first you increase exercise, then
<br>
change your diet, then turn to statin drugs if the other
<br>
two steps aren’t effective.”
<br>
But you don’t know whether interventions are working
<br>
if you don’t monitor the blood or, in this case, the water.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the restoration project, Dahlgren and his
<br>
students will measure water-quality indicators such as
<br>
levels of nitrogen, phosphorous, dissolved oxygen, and algae.
<br>
<br>
The group internship got underway last fall with
<br>
10 undergraduates majoring in Environmental Science
<br>
and Management.
<br>
<br>
“It was a lot of fun,” said Samuel Moose, a member of
<br>
the inaugural group. “I really enjoyed the fieldwork and the
<br>
opportunity to solve problems.”
<br>
“And we got to see the big picture,” added Anna Britzman,
<br>
who plans to pursue a career in wildlife conservation. “We
<br>
worked with so many experts, and it helped me see how
<br>
important water quality is to restoring wildlife habitat.”
