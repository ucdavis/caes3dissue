Using GPS collars,
<br>
researchers tracked which
<br>
cattle spent most of their time
<br>
in the valleys and which cattle
<br>
grazed along steep slopes.
<br>
<br>
This image shows the grazing
<br>
pattern of two young heifers
<br>
tracked on a ranch in New
<br>
Mexico. The turquoise-dot
<br>
heifer roamed the hillsides,
<br>
while the pink-dot heifer
<br>
primarily grazed gentle terrain.

select for hill climbing?”

Bailey joined forces with Medrano and a team
<br>
of researchers, including animal genetics expert
<br>
Milton Thomas at Colorado State University.
<br>
<br>
Funded by a grant from Western Sustainable
<br>
Agriculture Research and Education, the group is
<br>
close to developing a genetic test for whether a bull
<br>
is likely to sire daughters who like to climb hills.
<br>
<br>
LOCOMOTION, MOTIVATION, AND
<br>
SPATIAL LEARNING
<br>
To identify hill-climbing cattle, Bailey
<br>
and his crew put GPS collars on 180 cows on
<br>
seven ranches in three western states and took
<br>
measurements every 10 minutes for months at a
<br>
time. They tracked the cattle’s slope use, elevation
<br>
gain, and distance traveled from water. They
<br>
also took blood samples that Medrano and his
<br>
team analyzed for chromosomal commonalities.
<br>
<br>
Medrano found overlap in genes linked to
<br>
locomotion, motivation, and spatial learning.
<br>
<br>
“Results so far are very encouraging,”
<br>
Medrano said. “Soon we will be able to test and
<br>
breed for hill-climbing behavior.”
<br>
Breeding for one trait can sometimes produce
<br>
unintended consequences like predisposition
<br>
to disease or low calf weight. Researchers are
<br>
looking closely at that possibility, and have so
<br>
far found no correlation between hill-climbing
<br>
behavior and undesired traits.
<br>
<br>
“We’ve looked at calf-weaning weights,
<br>
pregnancy rates, blood pressure, even
<br>
disposition,” Bailey said. “We had one theory
<br>
that hill-climbing cows tended toward the
<br>
meaner end of the scale, but that’s not the case.
<br>
<br>
“Some cows just prefer to climb more than
<br>
other cows,” Bailey continued. “And if breeding
<br>
can move the bell curve in that direction,
<br>
“I’VE BEEN WATCHING CATTLE FOR YEARS,
<br>
AND THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME COWS THAT
<br>
JUST TAKE OFF FOR THE HILLS, LIKE THEY
<br>
DIDN’T KNOW THEY WEREN’T ELK.”
<br>
management tools like fencing and herding
<br>
will be much more effective.”
<br>
California ranchers are intrigued by the
<br>
possibility. “I can see many ecological and economic
<br>
benefits to breeding for cows who like to
<br>
travel,” said Clayton Koopmann, a rancher
<br>
and rangeland-management consultant who
<br>
runs cattle on hilly ground throughout the San
<br>
Francisco Bay Area. “Forage would be consumed
<br>
more evenly, and that’s good for livestock
<br>
production and for the environment.”
