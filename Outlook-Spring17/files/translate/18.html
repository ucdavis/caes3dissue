What’s Cookin’ in
<br>
CA&ES? Fresh Rag Pasta with Peas and
<br>
Asparagus adopted from The
<br>
Davis Farmers Market Cookbook
<br>
by Ann M. Evans
<br>
A passion for food
<br>
and a love of science is
<br>
apparent in two recent
<br>
books written by CA&ES alumni—Ali Bouzari’s Ingredient: Unveiling
<br>
the Essential Elements of Food, and Ann M. Evans’ updated edition of The
<br>
Davis Farmers Market Cookbook.
<br>
<br>
Ingredient explores eight basic elements found in every culinary
<br>
creation—water, sugars, carbs, lipids, proteins, minerals, gases, and heat.
<br>
<br>
“It’s a book designed for anyone who wants to understand the world of
<br>
food a little bit better,” said Bouzari (Ph.D., ’15 food science). “The idea
<br>
that I could write something applicable to a paleo-nutritionist, a chef
<br>
in a fine dining restaurant, and my grandmother cooking food for
<br>
Thanksgiving was really intriguing to me.”
<br>
The Davis Farmers Market Cookbook features 75 seasonal recipes.
<br>
<br>
“Eating what’s in season makes a difference in price and in flavor,”
<br>
said Evans (B.S., ’75 consumer food science). “You lose your connection
<br>
with nature when you don’t see and feel the seasons.” A portion of the
<br>
proceeds from her book sales will support the CA&ES Dean’s Circle
<br>
Scholarship Fund, a program that provides essential support to students
<br>
within the college.
<br>
<br>
Spice up your library with these two first-rate books from our food
<br>
science alumni who know a thing or two about good food, how to
<br>
prepare it, and the science behind it all. Both books are available in
<br>
regional stores, and online at ucdavisstores.com. Evans’ book is also
<br>
available at the Davis Farmers Market. —Charleen Floyd

Quality olive oil starts with freshly picked olives
<br>
rushed to the mill for pressing. In fall, UC Davis
<br>
students got a taste of the effort involved in harvest
<br>
by hand-gathering fruit from olive trees at campus
<br>
research groves.
<br>
<br>
“I’m amazed at the sheer number of olives it
<br>
takes to produce a small amount of olive oil,” said
<br>
Lauren Crawford, a food science graduate student
<br>
who helped with the harvest. Crawford’s research
<br>
at the UC Davis Olive Center lab focuses on
<br>
developing an enzymatic debittering process for
<br>

<br>
table olives, one that doesn’t produce toxic
<br>
waste water like traditional lye-based methods.
<br>
<br>
The fruits of the harvest are available at
<br>
UC Davis Stores, and online at ucdavisstores.com.

You can purchase UC Davis Olive Oil or try the
<br>
Olive Center’s newest product, Premium Dipping
<br>
Oil (shown left), which is a blend of extra virgin
<br>
olive oil from campus groves with balsamic vinegar
<br>
from Modena, Italy, along with garlic, herbs, and
<br>
spices. — Robin DeRieux
