MAKING A DIFFERENCE
<br>
Scholarship Support
<br>
Alumna Destinee Cooper contributes to programs that helped her
<br>
year, Destinee experienced fainting spells and
<br>
feared she would have to drop out of college.
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, that didn’t happen.
<br>
<br>
“My doctors found something that was
<br>
relatively minor,” she said. “It was a huge relief.”
<br>
DESTINEE COOPER (’04 ENVIRONMENTAL
<br>
TOXICOLOGY) is paying it forward by paying
<br>
it back.
<br>
<br>
As a youth, she knew she wanted to help
<br>
others. Bright and ambitious, she had her sights
<br>
set on college—the first in her family to dream
<br>
that big. She applied to and was accepted at four
<br>
UC campuses. She chose UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
“I knew I would be going through a huge
<br>
transition because my family was moving to
<br>
Montana,” the Modesto native said. “Davis
<br>
reminded me of home. It was a place I felt
<br>
comfortable with, and I felt like I’d be supported.
<br>
<br>
Right from the get-go, it was a good fit.”
<br>
Her instincts were right. She discovered an
<br>
interest in environmental toxicology and found
<br>
department faculty and staff who readily offered
<br>
their support—academically and through an
<br>
especially challenging time. During her senior

<br>
“I never forgot the fact that I was
<br>
helped in this manner.”
<br>
Destinee worked hard at her studies and always
<br>
held several jobs—as a math and chemistry tutor
<br>
and as an undergraduate research assistant
<br>
in a molecular biology lab studying yeast, a
<br>
Superfund lab investigating arsenic, and for the
<br>
Department of Viticulture and Enology working
<br>
with grapes.
<br>
<br>
Destinee and her family did not have the
<br>
resources to pay for her education at UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
“Once I got in, I wondered, ‘How am I going to
<br>
finance this? How do I support myself through
<br>
this process? Scholarships were the number
<br>
one thing.’”
<br>
Destinee was the recipient of the Henry Jastro
<br>
Scholarship and the Henry W. Seale Scholarship.
<br>
<br>
These scholarships were established in the early
<br>
years of the college by the families of California
<br>
ranchers, Jastro and Seale, to support students.
<br>
<br>
“Those programs not only supported my
<br>
academic career, they also gave me the money to
<br>
do research and to support me financially.”
<br>
A Native American of Crow descent, Destinee
<br>
is now in a satisfying career helping Native
<br>
American tribes in California and Arizona build
<br>
the capacity to address environmental needs. And
<br>
she is making regular contributions to the very
<br>
scholarships that made her education possible.
<br>
<br>
“I never forgot the fact that I was helped in
<br>
this manner,” she said. “I can make the sacrifices
<br>
to give back financially and to fulfill a promise I
<br>
made when I signed my scholarship agreements.
<br>
<br>
I had an awesome time at UC Davis, and I am
<br>
definitely grateful for everything I was able to
<br>
do while I was there. I want others to have the
<br>
same opportunity.”
