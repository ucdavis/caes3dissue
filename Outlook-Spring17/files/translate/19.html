THE STUDENT STORY
<br>
Andrew Fulks, assistant director of the UC Davis Arboretum and
<br>
Public Gardens, provides an update on the Arboretum Waterway
<br>
project to students who are helping with restoration efforts.

<br>
Homegrown experts
<br>
help restore the
<br>
Arboretum Waterway
<br>
in its mission to clean and
<br>
beautify the Arboretum Waterway: homegrown expertise.
<br>
<br>
An expanding group of undergraduate students—led by
<br>
Randy Dahlgren, a professor and world leader in
<br>
water-quality biogeochemistry—will sample the water and
<br>
provide important analysis throughout the university’s
<br>
multiyear effort to enhance the waterway. The students are
<br>
part of a new group internship Dahlgren designed to provide
<br>
undergraduates hands-on experience in water-quality and
<br>
aquatic-ecosystem restoration.
<br>
<br>
“It’s good for everyone,” Dahlgren said. “The students are
<br>
playing a critical role in solving real-world problems, which
<br>
gives restoration efforts a better chance to succeed and benefits
<br>
all of us who enjoy the centerpiece of the Arboretum.”
<br>
Visitors love walking the 3.5-mile loop around the
<br>
Arboretum Waterway—except when the water is covered with
<br>
unsightly duckweed and algae, a natural byproduct of what is
<br>
essentially a stagnant pond.
<br>
<br>
The waterway sits in the channel that used to be the North
<br>
Fork of Putah Creek, but long ago the creek was diverted due
<br>
to frequent flooding. Now, the waterway is dammed at both
<br>
ends and serves as a holding pond for storm runoff and a
<br>
receptacle for clean, recycled wastewater.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis recently launched a four-year project to reduce
<br>
algae growth and sedimentation by increasing water flow,
<br>

<br>
deepening and narrowing the channel, and planting more
<br>
native wetland vegetation on the banks.
<br>
<br>
“We’re introducing small elevation gains and a pump to
<br>
recirculate the water,” said Andrew Fulks, assistant director of
<br>
the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Gardens. “Picture a series
<br>
of large, natural steps with water cascading down.”
<br>
HOW MONITORING WATER QUALITY HELPS
<br>
Water quality is not a toggle switch, not something you
<br>
switch on and off.
<br>
<br>
“It’s like cholesterol in our blood,” Dahlgren explained.
<br>
<br>
“When your cholesterol is too high, you take progressive
<br>
steps to lower it. Maybe first you increase exercise, then
<br>
change your diet, then turn to statin drugs if the other
<br>
two steps aren’t effective.”
<br>
But you don’t know whether interventions are working
<br>
if you don’t monitor the blood or, in this case, the water.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the restoration project, Dahlgren and his
<br>
students will measure water-quality indicators such as
<br>
levels of nitrogen, phosphorous, dissolved oxygen, and algae.
<br>
<br>
The group internship got underway last fall with
<br>
10 undergraduates majoring in Environmental Science
<br>
and Management.
<br>
<br>
“It was a lot of fun,” said Samuel Moose, a member of
<br>
the inaugural group. “I really enjoyed the fieldwork and the
<br>
opportunity to solve problems.”
<br>
“And we got to see the big picture,” added Anna Britzman,
<br>
who plans to pursue a career in wildlife conservation. “We
<br>
worked with so many experts, and it helped me see how
<br>
important water quality is to restoring wildlife habitat.”
