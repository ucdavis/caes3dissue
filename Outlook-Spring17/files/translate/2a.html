<br>
Focus on Breeding, Genetics, and Genomics
<br>
HUMANS BEGAN EXPERIMENTING with
<br>
selective breeding thousands of years ago when plants and
<br>
animals were first domesticated, but it wasn’t
<br>
until the mid-19th century when Gregor Mendel
<br>
demonstrated the fundamentals of heredity with
<br>
scientific experiments on peas that the field of
<br>
genetics got its start. Today we live in a world
<br>
where knowledge of the form and function of
<br>
genes has exploded through many disciplines in the
<br>
agricultural, environmental, and human sciences.
<br>
<br>
Our college and UC Davis in general are
<br>
at the forefront of developing new knowledge
<br>
about genetics and its many related disciplines
<br>
like genomics and bioinformatics. We need
<br>
this knowledge now more than ever. The world
<br>
population is currently estimated to be 7.5 billion—
<br>
and growing. Society’s challenge is how to
<br>
sustainably feed this growing world population
<br>
while maintaining a healthy environment.
<br>
<br>
Breeders of plants and animals need the
<br>
information created by geneticists and other
<br>
scientists to develop resilient species that are
<br>
more productive and less susceptible to diseases,
<br>
pests, and the uncertainties of a changing
<br>
climate. Natural resources professionals use
<br>
genetic knowledge of biodiversity to maintain
<br>
a healthy environment. Medical professionals
<br>
understand much more about human health
<br>
and wellness today as a result of genetics.
<br>
<br>
Our ability to understand DNA, gene
<br>
expression, and how life manifests in the world
<br>
has improved markedly with the new tools
<br>
of recent years. Next-generation sequencing
<br>
technology and the more robust data-crunching
<br>
power of today’s computers enable scientists to
<br>
look at tens of thousands of genetic markers.
<br>
<br>
This empowers researchers to learn more about
<br>
population genetics in wildlife, pest resistance in
<br>
crops, or disease pathways in humans.
<br>
<br>
We are committed to leading in the discovery
<br>
and development of new technologies and
<br>
new knowledge that will benefit our food and
<br>
agriculture systems, our communities, and
<br>
our environment. That necessitates a deep
<br>
understanding of the basic building blocks of life.
<br>
<br>
This issue of Outlook provides a glimpse into
<br>
that world and our contribution to the science
<br>
of genetics.

GENETICS IS THE SCIENCE OF HEREDITY.
<br>
<br>
The applications of new discoveries in
<br>
genetics are as varied as the individuals
<br>
within a species.
<br>
<br>
Faculty in the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences are using
<br>
genetic strategies to keep crop varieties
<br>
robust in the face of changing weather
<br>
patterns. They are sampling DNA in
<br>
waterways to help manage invasive
<br>
species. They are identifying genetic
<br>
markers to breed livestock that show
<br>
increased resistance to disease or other
<br>
favorable traits. They are looking at how
<br>
genes affect a person’s response to stress.
<br>
<br>
In the pages that follow, we take a
<br>
closer look at examples of genetics and
<br>
genomics research being conducted by
<br>
UC Davis scientists.
