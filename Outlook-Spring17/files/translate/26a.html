Mussel Dogs muscle in to protect

California waterways

hide-and-seek, and that is
<br>
good news for aquatic environments, municipal

water supplies, and people who enjoy California’s

lakes and reservoirs.

instruments known to man, a dog’s sense

<br>
Native to parts of Europe, quagga and zebra
<br>
mussels wreak havoc in Western waterways,
<br>
where they first appeared in 2007. They eat native
<br>
species’ food and create an environment that kills
<br>
fish eggs and attracts toxic algae.

POPEYE LIKES TO PLAY
<br>

<br>
“The best detection dogs are ball
<br>
crazy, because it’s really just a huge
<br>
game of hide-and-seek. “
<br>
Debi DeShon visits her
<br>
alma mater with two
<br>
of her dogs, Popeye
<br>
and Shelby.
<br>
<br>
24 Popeye is a chocolate lab working with
<br>
UC Davis alumna Debi DeShon (’87, agricultural
<br>
science and management) to sniff out invasive
<br>
quagga and zebra mussels that destroy any
<br>
waterway they infest. DeShon and her “Mussel
<br>
Dogs” contract with several lakes and reservoirs
<br>
in California to inspect incoming boats to make
<br>
sure no tiny, invasive mussels have hitchhiked
<br>
a ride.
<br>
<br>
“Mussel Dogs have given us a significant
<br>
technological breakthrough in the difficult fight
<br>
against zebra and quagga mussels,” said Scott
<br>
Cameron, president of the national Reduce Risks
<br>
from Invasive Species Coalition, which recently
<br>
honored DeShon for her work. “They do it by
<br>
tapping into one of the most sensitive detection
<br>
OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017
<br>
Invasive-mussel inspections are not
<br>
mandatory at most lakes and reservoirs in
<br>
California. But more waterway managers are
<br>
investing in preventative inspections because the
<br>
Department of Motor Vehicles has made funding
<br>
available, and the cost of coping with a mussel
<br>
invasion is so high.
<br>
<br>
Humans can protect against mussels by taking
<br>
about 20 minutes per boat to hose the hull with
<br>
scalding, hot water. It takes dogs about two
<br>
minutes to check for mussels.
<br>
<br>
“Popeye and our other Mussel Dogs—Noah,
<br>
Nemo, Captain, and Sinbad—can inspect about
<br>
110 boats a day,” DeShon said from her home
<br>
outside Turlock.
<br>
<br>
DeShon trains dogs for a variety of missions,
<br>
such as sniffing out a form of yeast in wineries
<br>
that can taint the flavor of wine, detecting bed
<br>
bugs, and providing companionship to veterans
<br>
coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. She
<br>
works with the Green Dog Rescue Project based
<br>
in Windsor, California, where she helps dogs find
<br>
their true calling in life.
<br>
<br>
“We got Nemo from someone who couldn’t
<br>
keep him anymore,” DeShon said. “He was
<br>
barking and driving the neighbors crazy. He was
<br>
just bored.”
<br>
The best detection dogs, DeShon said, are
<br>
“ball crazy, because it’s really just a huge game of
<br>
hide-and-seek.” —Diane Nelson

FINAL FRAME

<br>
Cute Kid
<br>
Genetic engineering makes it possible to improve agriculture in ways that traditional breeding cannot.
<br>
<br>
Animal science professors Jim Murray (above) and Elizabeth Maga have spent many years working on a
<br>
line of genetically engineered dairy goats that produce higher levels of a protein called lysozyme in their
<br>
milk. Lysozyme is an enzyme naturally found in human breast milk. The enzyme has antibacterial properties
<br>
that help protect babies against diarrhea and promotes growth of a healthy gastrointestinal tract.
<br>
<br>
The researchers introduced the human gene into the goat genome to produce higher levels of lysozyme
<br>
in goats’ milk. The hope is that milk produced by these transgenic goats could one day be used to help
<br>
prevent deadly diarrhea in weaned children of the developing world.
