UC Davis geneticist and animal science
<br>
professor Huaijun Zhou hopes that new
<br>
discoveries in chicken genome research
<br>
will help breed a more robust chicken
<br>
that offers greater food security to
<br>
poor African households.
<br>
<br>
Led by Zhou, an international
<br>
group of multidisciplinary
<br>
researchers is working on advanced
<br>
genetic and genomic approaches to
<br>
develop new strains of chickens with
<br>
enhanced protection from both Newcastle
<br>
disease and the heat stress that chickens face in
<br>
harsh African climates. Scientists are more than
<br>
three years into the five-year Feed the Future
<br>
Innovation Lab for Genomics to Improve Poultry
<br>
project, which has $6 million in USAID funding.
<br>
<br>
“There is a genetic component to disease
<br>
and heat resistance,” said Zhou, who is a
<br>
UC Davis Chancellor’s Fellow. “We aren’t saying
<br>
the genetic or genomic approach will replace
<br>
vaccinations—we’re taking a complementary

What is a genome?
<br>
And what does it mean when scientists say they have sequenced a genome?
<br>
of the four building
<br>
blocks that make up an individual
<br>
organism’s DNA code—represented by
<br>
the letters A, T, C, and G—is called a
<br>
DNA sequence. A genome is the entire
<br>
DNA sequence for an organism.
<br>
<br>
For example, an international team
<br>
of geneticists sequenced the chicken
<br>
genome in 2004—they determined the
<br>
exact order of the letters representing
<br>
the building blocks, or base pairs, of the
<br>
organism’s DNA.
<br>
<br>
Chickens, like any organism, are
<br>
likely to share 99.5 percent of the same
<br>
base pairs in the same sequence.
<br>
<br>
Because there are approximately
<br>
1 billion base pairs in the chicken
<br>
genome, the 0.5 percent difference
<br>
translates to nearly half a million genetic
<br>
variations between any two individuals.
<br>
<br>
THE EXACT ORDER

<br>
Genes are partial segments of
<br>
the genome, varied in size, that
<br>
account for differences in appearance,
<br>
resilience, and other traits expressed
<br>
in an organism—collectively called the
<br>
“phenotype.” In the case of chickens, examples of
<br>
phenotype include brown feathers, white
<br>
feathers, good layer, bad layer, muscular
<br>
chickens, fat chickens.
<br>
<br>
Once an organism’s genome has been
<br>
sequenced, scientists seek to identify the
<br>
genes or genetic markers associated with
<br>
traits of interest.
<br>
<br>
Some traits are determined by a single
<br>
gene. More often, many genes work
<br>
together to specify a trait. Most traits
<br>
are influenced by both genes and the
<br>
environment. Information gleaned from a
<br>
sequenced genome helps researchers
<br>
make breeding decisions for crops or
<br>
livestock that will more reliably and
<br>
efficiently produce the desired results.
<br>
<br>
Think of the genome as a book that
<br>
contains a set of directions to build
<br>
an organism.
<br>
<br>
Inside the book are sentences—genes
<br>
that instruct cells how to make proteins
<br>
that affect various traits.
<br>
<br>
But a genome is no easy book
<br>
to read.
<br>
<br>
It’s like a stream-of-
<br>
consciousness opus with no
<br>
capitalization or punctuation,
<br>
no clear indication where
<br>
words end or sentences begin.
<br>
<br>
Strings of extra letters are
<br>
randomly inserted throughout.
<br>
<br>
Scientists have to discern
