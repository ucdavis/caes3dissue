UC Davis embodies a long tradition of

scientists advancing the knowledge
<br>
of honey bees, and entomology
<br>
professor Brian Johnson has joined
<br>
that tradition through his study of
<br>
honey-bee genetics, evolution, and
<br>
behavior. Johnson is exploring new
<br>
areas in honey-bee genetics.

2 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017
<br>
Packing a mule requires skill. Doing it quickly, working with
<br>
unfamiliar animals, competing in an arena against other
<br>
collegians, and making sure no equipment falls off before
<br>
your mule crosses the finish line—that challenge was met by
<br>
four UC Davis animal science students who took a first-place
<br>
win in the 2016 Intercollegiate Packing Competition. The
<br>
packing competition was one of many contests held during
<br>
Mule Days, an annual Memorial Day Weekend event
<br>
in Bishop, California.
<br>
<br>
Students at the Horse Barn, part of the Department of
<br>
Animal Science, formed the UC Davis packing team only
<br>
three years ago. They receive support from veterinarian and
<br>
UC Davis alumnus Craig London of the Rock Creek Pack
<br>
Station and coaching assistance from Andy Assereto of the
<br>
Backcountry Horsemen of California Mother Lode Unit.
<br>
<br>
“In the arena, the competition was so fierce, yet come
<br>
dinnertime, all the competitors would come together and have a
<br>
great time around the fire,” said senior Kayla Wigney. “We look
<br>
forward to packing together or against each other in the future.”

BREAKING THE CODE
<br>
Using discoveries in genetics to make
<br>
poultry more resistant to disease and
<br>
heat stress

<br>
IN RURAL AFRICAN VILLAGES ,
<br>
chickens provide families with
<br>
much more than meat and eggs.
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, it is women who tend small backyard flocks.
<br>
<br>
Chickens provide high-protein sustenance for families, as well
<br>
as income that empowers women and improves their quality
<br>
of life. Raising indigenous chickens is a relatively minor
<br>
investment compared to cattle, pigs, or other livestock, since
<br>
the birds scavenge for food and live outdoors without housing.
<br>
<br>
But rural poultry production in Africa is threatened by
<br>
the number one avian virus on the continent—Newcastle
<br>
disease. Newcastle is a highly contagious respiratory illness
<br>
that can decimate entire flocks in a matter of days. In the
<br>
United States and other developed countries, the disease is
<br>
controlled through vaccination. In African countries, various
<br>
obstacles prevent the Newcastle vaccine from being a feasible
<br>
means to protect poultry.
