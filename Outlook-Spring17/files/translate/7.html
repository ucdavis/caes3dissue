approach. We want to identify the genetic
<br>
markers that are associated with resistance and
<br>
use the natural variation to breed birds that are
<br>
more resilient.”
<br>
Another component of the poultry project is to
<br>
build capacity—renovating facilities and training
<br>
scientists at Sokoine University of Agriculture in
<br>
Tanzania and at the University of Ghana so that
<br>
the work in these countries can continue beyond
<br>
the initial involvement of American universities.
<br>
<br>
One of the most difficult aspects of the project
<br>
“Each gene involved tends to contribute a small
<br>
genetic effect, making them hard to detect.”
<br>
is that disease and heat resistance are complex
<br>
traits, which means they are controlled by many
<br>
genes—perhaps hundreds. “Each gene involved
<br>
tends to contribute a small genetic effect,
<br>
making them hard to detect,” said Zhou. “It’s a
<br>
tremendous challenge.”

which parts of the book code for genes, what those
<br>
genes do, and how they interact with other genes
<br>
to determine individual traits.
<br>
<br>
Add to that, a book containing the entire
<br>
genome for a species reads pretty much the same
<br>
for any two individuals.
<br>
<br>
The book is so long that the small differences
<br>
in wording account for significant differences
<br>
in outcome.
<br>
<br>
So while sequencing a genome provides
<br>
scientists with a book of
<br>
instructions, it’s a book that
<br>
needs to be decoded in order
<br>
to be understood. Once
<br>
researchers can read the story,
<br>
they have to figure out what the
<br>
story means.

Gene editing uses molecular “scissors” to precisely cut DNA
<br>
sequences at a particular location in the genome. Think of it as
<br>
using spellcheck for a gene. By tinkering with the individual letters
<br>
at a precise location, scientists can introduce a preferred trait,
<br>
one that already exists as a naturally occurring variation within
<br>
the species.
<br>
<br>
Gene editing has been used to prevent horn formation in cattle,
<br>
eliminating the need to remove horns from dairy cows .

GENETIC ENGINEERING
<br>
Genetic engineering is the process of transferring a specific gene
<br>
from the genome of one organism into another to pass along a
<br>
desired trait or function. An organism that has been genetically
<br>
engineered is called a Genetically Modified Organism, or GMO. This
<br>
term can be confusing because traditional selective breeding also
<br>
modifies a species—like domestic dogs and their ancestor, the wolf.
<br>
<br>
Genetically engineered offspring can also be called “transgenic.”
<br>
Genetic engineering was used to create a papaya variety
<br>
resistant to ringspot disease by introducing DNA from the virus,
<br>
which essentially vaccinated the fruit against the virus. Genetic
<br>
engineering was used because papaya contains no naturally
<br>
occurring genetic resistance to the virus.
