Variable weather is creating extreme
<br>
challenges for crop breeding in California.
<br>
<br>
that will thrive under
<br>
certain conditions when you can no longer predict
<br>
what those conditions will be?
<br>
“It’s the question we’re all asking,” said Charlie
<br>
Brummer, professor and director of the UC Davis
<br>
Plant Breeding Center. “Our weather patterns are
<br>
changing so fast, affecting everything from soil
<br>
composition to what to expect in terms of weeds,
<br>
diseases, and pests. It can take 10 years to develop
<br>
a new crop variety, even more for perennial plants.
<br>
<br>
So we have to extrapolate what the future will
<br>
bring—very, very quickly.”
<br>
Changes have already begun, according to Allen
<br>
Van Deynze, director of research at the UC Davis
<br>
Seed Biotechnology Center. A spike in insects and
<br>
the viruses they transmit are threatening vegetable
<br>
crops in California and beyond.
<br>
<br>
“An extra four-to-six weeks of heat can produce
<br>
another generation of aphids and wipe out an
<br>
entire crop,” Van Deynze explained. “The insects
<br>
are multiplying very fast.”
<br>
Extreme variations in localized weather
<br>
pose a bigger challenge to breeders than long-
<br>
term climate shift. If you know weather will
<br>
trend hotter, you can plan for that. It is the wild
<br>
swings—the longer droughts and more intense
<br>
floodings—that are tricky.
<br>
<br>
“The insects, weeds, and other pests that thrive
<br>
in more humid settings are different from those
<br>
you find during drought,” Brummer said. “We’re
<br>
working to breed crops that can adapt to it all.”
<br>
HOW DO YOU DEVELOP CROPS
<br>
Breeders and engineers at UC Davis are helping
<br>
crops keep pace with variable weather by using
<br>
advanced genetic strategies, developing robotic
<br>
sensors to measure plant performance, and
<br>
training the next generation of plant breeders.
<br>
<br>
Time-lapse evolution
<br>
UC Davis breeders help develop new cultivars,
<br>
or varieties, of the nearly 400 fruits, vegetables,
<br>
nuts, grains, and ornamentals grown year-round
<br>
in California’s diverse environments. To create a
<br>
winning variety, breeders cross plants with desired
<br>
traits and select the best offspring over multiple
<br>
generations. That is essentially how humans
<br>
have been improving crops since the dawn of
<br>
agriculture 10,000 years ago.
<br>
<br>
But breeding has become faster and smarter,
<br>
thanks to rapid improvements in DNA sequencing
<br>
and the computer power to analyze a wealth of
<br>
genetic data.
<br>
<br>
Some plant traits, such as flavor and size,
<br>
are determined by many genes acting together.
<br>
<br>
Other traits, such as resistance to a disease,
<br>
may be regulated by a single gene. Breeders can
<br>
now identify genes that influence some traits at
<br>
the molecular level, so they can select plants at
<br>
the seed or seedling stage based on their DNA
<br>
sequence rather than wait for traits to express
<br>
themselves as the plants mature. That speeds up
<br>
the process.
