Genetic engineering makes it possible to improve agriculture in ways that traditional breeding cannot.
<br>
<br>
Animal science professors Jim Murray (above) and Elizabeth Maga have spent many years working on a
<br>
line of genetically engineered dairy goats that produce higher levels of a protein called lysozyme in their
<br>
milk. Lysozyme is an enzyme naturally found in human breast milk. The enzyme has antibacterial properties
<br>
that help protect babies against diarrhea and promotes growth of a healthy gastrointestinal tract.
<br>
<br>
The researchers introduced the human gene into the goat genome to produce higher levels of lysozyme
<br>
in goats’ milk. The hope is that milk produced by these transgenic goats could one day be used to help
<br>
prevent deadly diarrhea in weaned children of the developing world.
