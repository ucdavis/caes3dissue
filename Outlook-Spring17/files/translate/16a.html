<br>
Raptor research takes flight
<br>
Cooper’s hawks are a fairly common yet understudied
<br>
species. Hull’s group is interested in finding out which
<br>
populations are being monitored by GGRO. Graduate student
<br>
Breanna Martinico is analyzing Cooper’s hawk DNA from
<br>
the Marin Headlands and from other locations around the
<br>
country. “Are we monitoring a local population of California birds
<br>
or are we monitoring a population migrating from someplace
<br>
else?” Hull asks. “That’s important because if we see a decline,
<br>
where should we look for the problem? We’ve seen this in red-
<br>
tailed hawks with two distinct populations that fly through
<br>
the Marin Headlands—one from California and one from the
<br>
northern Intermountain West.”
<br>
The Harlan’s hawk is categorized as a subspecies of red-
<br>
tailed hawk, but some people believe it is a separate species.
<br>
<br>
“There’s a lot of debate about this because there’s a lot of
<br>
variation in the birds’ plumage,” Hull said. “Each individual
<br>
looks different from the next to a much greater extent than
<br>
any other raptor species that we work with.”
<br>
Genetic analyses by graduate student Megan Mayo have
<br>
shown, however, that the Harlan’s hawk and red-tailed
<br>
hawk are the same species. “We’re confident that they’re
<br>
not a different species and we’re confident that they are
<br>
interbreeding, so that leaves some other ecological factor that
<br>
is causing this variation to persist,” Hull said.
<br>
<br>
Raptors are birds of prey such as hawks and falcons that
<br>
provide a number of important environmental benefits. Some
<br>
raptors—barn owls, for instance—keep rodent populations
<br>
in check. Raptors can indicate the presence of environmental
<br>
contaminants. Many years ago, scientists established a
<br>
connection between DDT and the decline of bald eagles,
<br>
peregrines, and ospreys. Since that pesticide was banned in
<br>
1972, these species have recovered.
<br>
<br>
“Raptors signal a healthy ecosystem” said Josh Hull, an
<br>
adjunct professor in the Department of Animal Science. “They
<br>
are also a good indicator of species diversity.”
<br>
Hull studies raptors with a team of graduate students
<br>
and colleagues at UC Davis. They are using genetic tools
<br>
to understand more about individuals in a population, the
<br>
relationships among different populations, and the prey
<br>
species that are important to survival. With the advent of next-
<br>
generation sequencing technology, more powerful computers,
<br>
and good old-fashioned field work, Hull’s team is gaining new
<br>
insight into these magnificent birds to assist wildlife managers
<br>
in conservation efforts.
<br>
<br>
For instance, Yosemite National Park has
<br>
a genetically distinct population of great gray
<br>
owls—a “charismatic” species that is a high
<br>
priority for park managers. “They’re an isolated
<br>
population that appears to have been on its own
<br>
for many thousands of years,” Hull said. “They
<br>
appear to be very rare, but we don’t have a good
<br>
sense of how this population is doing.”
<br>
One of Hull’s students, Joe Medley, devoted his
<br>
graduate work to collecting molted feathers from
<br>
known nesting areas in the park’s high country.
<br>
<br>
From those samples, DNA has been extracted and
<br>
genetic markers called microsatellites were used
<br>
to identify individual owls and get a better sense
<br>
of population status.
<br>
<br>
The sharp-shinned hawk is the smallest hawk
<br>
in North America. Working with Golden Gate
<br>
Raptor Observatory (GGRO) scientists, graduate
<br>
student Ryan Bourbour has collected DNA samples
<br>
with a swab from the birds’ beaks to learn what
<br>
these hawks are eating while migrating.
<br>
<br>
“People are always asking, ‘What do
<br>
hawks eat?’” Hull said. “Beyond that, from a
<br>
Ecology Graduate Group Ph.D. student Megan
<br>
