GENETICS IS THE SCIENCE OF HEREDITY.
<br>
<br>
The applications of new discoveries in
<br>
genetics are as varied as the individuals
<br>
within a species.
<br>
<br>
Faculty in the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences are using
<br>
genetic strategies to keep crop varieties
<br>
robust in the face of changing weather
<br>
patterns. They are sampling DNA in
<br>
waterways to help manage invasive
<br>
species. They are identifying genetic
<br>
markers to breed livestock that show
<br>
increased resistance to disease or other
<br>
favorable traits. They are looking at how
<br>
genes affect a person’s response to stress.
<br>
<br>
In the pages that follow, we take a
<br>
closer look at examples of genetics and
<br>
genomics research being conducted by
<br>
UC Davis scientists.

ON THE COVER
<br>
UC Davis geneticist Huaijun Zhou
<br>
leads an international group of
<br>
researchers seeking advanced
<br>
genetic and genomic solutions to
<br>
breeding more robust chickens.
