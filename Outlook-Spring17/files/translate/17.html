an amphibian species’ resistance to disease,” Todd said,
<br>
“and conservationists can use this information in service of
<br>
captive breeding or other efforts that seek to maintain healthy
<br>
amphibian populations globally.”
<br>
Raptor research takes flight
<br>
Cooper’s hawks are a fairly common yet understudied
<br>
species. Hull’s group is interested in finding out which
<br>
populations are being monitored by GGRO. Graduate student
<br>
Breanna Martinico is analyzing Cooper’s hawk DNA from
<br>
the Marin Headlands and from other locations around the
<br>
country. “Are we monitoring a local population of California birds
<br>
or are we monitoring a population migrating from someplace
<br>
else?” Hull asks. “That’s important because if we see a decline,
<br>
where should we look for the problem? We’ve seen this in red-
<br>
tailed hawks with two distinct populations that fly through
<br>
the Marin Headlands—one from California and one from the
<br>
northern Intermountain West.”
<br>
The Harlan’s hawk is categorized as a subspecies of red-
<br>
tailed hawk, but some people believe it is a separate species.
<br>
<br>
“There’s a lot of debate about this because there’s a lot of
<br>
variation in the birds’ plumage,” Hull said. “Each individual
<br>
looks different from the next to a much greater extent than
<br>
any other raptor species that we work with.”
<br>
Genetic analyses by graduate student Megan Mayo have
<br>
shown, however, that the Harlan’s hawk and red-tailed
<br>
hawk are the same species. “We’re confident that they’re
<br>
not a different species and we’re confident that they are
<br>
interbreeding, so that leaves some other ecological factor that
<br>
is causing this variation to persist,” Hull said.
<br>
<br>
Raptors are birds of prey such as hawks and falcons that
<br>
provide a number of important environmental benefits. Some
<br>
raptors—barn owls, for instance—keep rodent populations
<br>
in check. Raptors can indicate the presence of environmental
<br>
contaminants. Many years ago, scientists established a
<br>
connection between DDT and the decline of bald eagles,
<br>
peregrines, and ospreys. Since that pesticide was banned in
<br>
1972, these species have recovered.
<br>
<br>
“Raptors signal a healthy ecosystem” said Josh Hull, an
<br>
adjunct professor in the Department of Animal Science. “They
<br>
are also a good indicator of species diversity.”
<br>
Hull studies raptors with a team of graduate students
<br>
and colleagues at UC Davis. They are using genetic tools
<br>
to understand more about individuals in a population, the
<br>
relationships among different populations, and the prey
<br>
species that are important to survival. With the advent of next-
<br>
generation sequencing technology, more powerful computers,
<br>
and good old-fashioned field work, Hull’s team is gaining new
<br>
insight into these magnificent birds to assist wildlife managers
<br>
in conservation efforts.
<br>
<br>
For instance, Yosemite National Park has
<br>
a genetically distinct population of great gray
<br>
owls—a “charismatic” species that is a high
<br>
priority for park managers. “They’re an isolated
<br>
population that appears to have been on its own
<br>
for many thousands of years,” Hull said. “They
<br>
appear to be very rare, but we don’t have a good
<br>
sense of how this population is doing.”
<br>
One of Hull’s students, Joe Medley, devoted his
<br>
graduate work to collecting molted feathers from
<br>
known nesting areas in the park’s high country.
<br>
<br>
From those samples, DNA has been extracted and
<br>
genetic markers called microsatellites were used
<br>
to identify individual owls and get a better sense
<br>
of population status.
<br>
<br>
The sharp-shinned hawk is the smallest hawk
<br>
in North America. Working with Golden Gate
<br>
Raptor Observatory (GGRO) scientists, graduate
<br>
student Ryan Bourbour has collected DNA samples
<br>
with a swab from the birds’ beaks to learn what
<br>
these hawks are eating while migrating.
<br>
<br>
“People are always asking, ‘What do
<br>
hawks eat?’” Hull said. “Beyond that, from a
<br>
Ecology Graduate Group Ph.D. student Megan
<br>
conservation perspective, this is going to help
<br>
Mayo has been studying population variation
<br>
us understand what these birds need.”

in tundra-breeding, rough-legged hawks, which

Work is now underway to sequence

DNA that will identify prey species of the

warming. Knowledge of this species’ population

structure can help determine areas of

importance for conservation management.
