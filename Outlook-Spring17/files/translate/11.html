eight years to two or three years.”

The next frontier: fast phenotyping
<br>
To accelerate breeding, genomics are
<br>
only part of the equation. Breeders also

need to phenotype, which is to measure
<br>
traits as plants grow in the field.
<br>
<br>
“Molecular tools help us find genes
<br>
of interest for some traits, but you don’t
<br>
really know what you have for other traits
<br>
until you make your crosses and grow
<br>
plants in the field,” Brummer explained.

“That’s revolutionary,” Brummer said. “Breeding
