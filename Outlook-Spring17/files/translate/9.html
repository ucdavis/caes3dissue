<br>
how we respond to stress. Science
<br>
shows that some people are more genetically predisposed
<br>
than others to develop depression and anxiety in response
<br>
to stressful situations.
<br>
<br>
What’s more, researchers say that chronic exposure to
<br>
stressful conditions—such as poverty, family discord, and
<br>
poor nutrition—can alter the way genes behave in children
<br>
and adolescents, making them more susceptible to depression,
<br>
anxiety, and other negative effects of stress.
<br>
<br>
But mounting evidence from scientists with the UC Davis
<br>
Department of Human Ecology suggests there is also an upside
<br>
to the link between genetics and environmental exposure. In
<br>
many cases, the same people who are most adversely affected
<br>
by negative experiences also benefit the most from supportive
<br>
and even benign environments.
<br>
<br>
“It’s not just that some individuals are more ‘vulnerable’
<br>
to adversity, but rather that some people are more
<br>
developmentally malleable for better and for worse,” explained
<br>
Jay Belsky, professor of human development. “Many of the
<br>
genes long thought to operate as a risk factor for problem
<br>
behavior when things go poorly may also be an opportunity
<br>
factor when children are exposed to interventions and when
<br>
things go well.”
<br>
Belsky and his colleague, human development professor
<br>
Johnna Swartz, are uncovering intriguing clues about the
<br>
connection between genetics, stress, and opportunity that
<br>
could change the way society views, treats, and prevents
<br>
depression, anxiety, and other disorders.
<br>
<br>
OUR GENES CAN INFLUENCE
<br>
FIGHT OR FLIGHT
<br>
Swartz and others have discovered that measures of brain
<br>
function, which are influenced by genetic variation, may
<br>
predict later psychiatric conditions. Working with Professor
<br>
Ahmad Hariri at Duke University, Swartz analyzed the
<br>
brain scans of 340 college students while they were looking
<br>
at images of angry or fearful faces. Swartz and colleagues
<br>
measured activity in the students’ amygdala—the tiny
<br>
emotion-processing center of the brain—to see how active
<br>
it was in response to the threatening stimuli.
<br>
<br>
After the measurements were taken, the students answered
<br>
questions assessing stress in their lives, as well as symptoms
<br>
of depression and anxiety. Students with more reactive
<br>
amygdalae at the start of the study—more exaggerated
<br>
fight-or-flight responses to the scared and angry faces—
<br>
experienced more severe symptoms in response to later
<br>
stressful situations in their lives.
<br>
<br>
“By identifying genetic markers that predict these patterns
<br>
of brain function, we could potentially guide people at higher
<br>
risk for depression and anxiety to seek preventative treatment
<br>
before symptoms become chronic and disruptive in their
<br>
lives,” Swartz said.
<br>
<br>
With further research, genetics could also help doctors
<br>
identify the imbalance or pathway causing a patient’s disorder
<br>
and more precisely treat the problem.
<br>
<br>
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
<br>
Both nature and nurture seem to play a role in how people
<br>
process stressful experiences. New research from Swartz
<br>
and Professor Douglas Williamson at Duke University links
<br>
poverty to changes in gene expression.
<br>
<br>
Their study followed 183 children ages 11 to 15 over
<br>
three years, testing them for symptoms of depression and
<br>
scanning their brain activity in response to photos of fearful
<br>
faces. During the course of the study, children from more
<br>
disadvantaged families had greater methylation—a process
<br>
that can change the way genes behave—of a gene that controls
<br>
levels of serotonin, which can affect a person’s mood. Children
<br>
with more methylation also had more active amygdalae, and
<br>
this predicted greater increases in depression symptoms a
<br>
year later.
<br>
<br>
“The small, daily challenges of scraping by can build up
<br>
and affect children’s development,” Swartz said. “It shows that
<br>
our biology is not set in stone, and environments can affect us
<br>
as deeply as levels of markers on our DNA.”
<br>
THE BRIGHT SIDE OF SUSCEPTIBILITY
<br>
Collaborating with scientists across the globe, Belsky has
<br>
spent years researching “differential susceptibility”—the
<br>
concept that some children are more likely to suffer in bad
<br>
settings and flourish in good ones due to their genetic makeup.
<br>
<br>
He has looked at the effect of quality care at orphanages in
<br>
Portugal, the link between prenatal stress and attention deficit
<br>
hyperactivity disorder, and how peer relations influence
<br>
hyperactivity and impulsivity, just to name a few areas of
<br>
research. And he has found a genetic connection.
<br>
<br>
For example, some variations of the serotonin-transporter
<br>
gene have been linked to depression. And variations of the
<br>
dopamine-receptor gene have been linked to attention deficit
<br>
hyperactivity disorder.
<br>
<br>
But that is not all.
<br>
<br>
“Intriguingly, these supposed ‘risk’ genes also turn out to
<br>
be associated with heightened sensitivity to environmental
<br>
conditions,” Belsky said. “Children who carry either or both
<br>
of them appear to be most adversely affected by negative
<br>
experiences, and seem to benefit most from supportive ones.”
<br>
And children without them seem relatively immune to the
<br>
effects of both supportive and unsupportive environments.
<br>
<br>
“Some people are more affected by their developmental
<br>
experiences than others,” Belsky said. “I think of it more
<br>
as diversity rather than damage. Genetics can inform our
<br>
understanding of human development and help us find ways
<br>
for all of us to thrive.”
