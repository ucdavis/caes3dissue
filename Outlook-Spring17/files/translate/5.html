IN RURAL AFRICAN VILLAGES ,
<br>
chickens provide families with
<br>
much more than meat and eggs.
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, it is women who tend small backyard flocks.
<br>
<br>
Chickens provide high-protein sustenance for families, as well
<br>
as income that empowers women and improves their quality
<br>
of life. Raising indigenous chickens is a relatively minor
<br>
investment compared to cattle, pigs, or other livestock, since
<br>
the birds scavenge for food and live outdoors without housing.
<br>
<br>
But rural poultry production in Africa is threatened by
<br>
the number one avian virus on the continent—Newcastle
<br>
disease. Newcastle is a highly contagious respiratory illness
<br>
that can decimate entire flocks in a matter of days. In the
<br>
United States and other developed countries, the disease is
<br>
controlled through vaccination. In African countries, various
<br>
obstacles prevent the Newcastle vaccine from being a feasible
<br>
means to protect poultry.
