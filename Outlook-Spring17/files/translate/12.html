BREEDING
<br>
HILL-CLIMBING COWS
<br>
BY DIANE NELSON
<br>
MOST OF THE 5 MILLION CATTLE THAT GRAZE
<br>
on California’s rangelands like to dine in the
<br>
valleys and hang out by creeks. This can lead to
<br>
overgrazing in riparian areas and let perfectly
<br>
good forage on hillsides go to waste.
<br>
<br>
But some cows are different. They prefer to
<br>
climb hills and mountains and eat along the way.
<br>
<br>
If more cattle followed the road less traveled,
<br>
rangelands would be more productive and
<br>
sustainable throughout California and the West.
<br>
<br>
That is why a team of researchers, including
<br>
UC Davis animal geneticist Juan Medrano, is
<br>
working to develop an easy, inexpensive genetic
<br>
test to help ranchers improve cattle distribution
<br>
by breeding hill-climbing cows.
<br>
<br>
“It’s very exciting research,” said Medrano, a
<br>
professor with the Department of Animal Science
<br>
who is collaborating with scientists throughout
<br>
the West. “DNA technology makes it relatively
<br>
easy to test and breed for production traits like
<br>
milk yield and growth rate. But it’s brand new
<br>
to identify genetic markers linked to animal
<br>
behavior. This could have a huge impact on
<br>
food security and rangeland management.”
<br>
NATURE AND NURTURE
<br>
One third of California—38 million acres—is
<br>
rangeland. Most of it is mountainous or hilly and
<br>
managed for livestock production. Grazing on
<br>
rangeland feeds livestock, but also offers many

<br>
environmental benefits such as keeping weeds
<br>
and other invasive species in check, providing
<br>
water storage and carbon sequestration, and
<br>
supporting habitat for animals and plants found
<br>
nowhere else in the world.
<br>
<br>
Problems arise, though, when rangeland is
<br>
overgrazed and cattle spend too much time near
<br>
running water, where manure and calving can
<br>
create water-quality risks for people downstream.
<br>
<br>
That is especially true in California. Some
<br>
80 percent of the state’s drinking and irrigation
<br>
water is stored on or passes through rangeland.
<br>
<br>
Researchers at UC Davis and beyond have
<br>
been working for decades with ranchers to keep
<br>
cattle from overgrazing and congregating by
<br>
creeks. They build strategic fencing, for example,
<br>
and provide water and salt licks on ridgetops
<br>
away from running water. Cowhands often herd
<br>
cattle from low-lying pastures, but that is
<br>
labor-intensive and only a temporary fix.
<br>
<br>
A few years ago, Derek Bailey, a professor of
<br>
range science at New Mexico State University
<br>
and a colleague of Medrano, had an intriguing
<br>
thought: What if we combine nature and nurture?
<br>
“I’ve been watching cattle for years, and there
<br>
are always some cows that just take off for the
<br>
hills, like they didn’t know they weren’t elk,”
<br>
Bailey said. “They could be belly-deep in green
<br>
grass, and just bolt for the hills. They like it up
<br>
there. We can breed for other traits. Why not
