A CLOSER LOOK
<br>
As a senior majoring in human development,
<br>
Andi Vilaboy works with preschoolers at the
<br>
Early Childhood Lab School on the UC Davis
<br>
campus. The Center for Child and Family Studies
<br>
gives undergraduates an opportunity to experience
<br>
what it’s like to work with young children and to
<br>
develop skills in translating theory and research
<br>
into effective interactions.
