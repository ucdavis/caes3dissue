Pathology Studies the biology
<br>
of plant responses to
<br>
environmental stressors
<br>
such as drought and
<br>
heat to better manage
<br>
crops in a changing
<br>
climate Applies cutting-edge
<br>
theories of social
<br>
inequality to empirically
<br>
analyze environmental
<br>
problems, such as how
<br>
society produces waste
<br>
and distributes landfills
<br>
Uses genomic, pedigree
<br>
and other sources of
<br>
big data in various live-

<br>
Analyzes soil and
<br>
plant-associated viruses
<br>
to discover what
<br>
viruses are present in
<br>
soil, what organisms
<br>
they infect, and how
<br>
viruses affect plant
<br>
health and productivity
