and make connections in industry,” said Martinez.

“When I go to a conference, people already know

my name, and they know I’m a resident at the

UC Davis sheep barn.”

At the sheep barn, lambing season runs from about
<br>
October through February, but most of the babies are born
<br>
in November, when sheep barn residents might handle up
<br>
to a dozen births per night. “Some of the first-time mothers
<br>
are lousy moms,” said Martinez. “So we put the mother
<br>
and the lamb in a small pen together where they can bond.
<br>
<br>
We make sure the lambs are getting milk, because the first
<br>
milk has lots of antibodies that help protect the babies
<br>
from infection.”

Midwifing during the wee hours can make it hard to
<br>
get up for classes the next day, but barn residents think
<br>
the experience is worth it. “It’s definitely rewarding,” said
<br>
Greenhut, who has spent many sleepless nights helping
<br>
cows give birth at the dairy. “But you need to know what
<br>
you’re in for.”
