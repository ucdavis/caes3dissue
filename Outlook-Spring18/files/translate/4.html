<br>
Science Says, a group created by
<br>
UC Davis graduate students to build
<br>
public understanding of science
<br>
through events, social media,
<br>
blog posts, a book club and other
<br>
activities, continues to make science
<br>
accessible to the general public.
<br>
<br>
In March, the group hosted a
<br>
screening of Food Evolution, a
<br>
documentary about the debate
<br>
surrounding Genetically Modified
<br>
Organisms (GMOs). One of their
<br>
most popular events is Sac Science
<br>
Distilled, a science cafe held monthly
<br>
in Sacramento that regularly draws
<br>
50 to 90 people.
<br>
<br>
“Science Says activities are
<br>
great for stimulating that innate
<br>
curiosity in everyone,” said program
<br>
coordinator Shannon Albers. Reach
<br>
her at snalbers@ucdavis.edu or visit
<br>
DavisScienceSays.com.
<br>
<br>
Science Says members work
<br>
on their design “What makes
<br>
a scientist?” at the Chalk It
<br>
Up! Festival in Sacramento.
