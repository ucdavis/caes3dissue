Life on the farm
<br>
The Barn Residency Program, which has been
<br>
around for more than 50 years, lets students live up
<br>
to two years at a single campus animal facility and
<br>
apply to a different barn when their tenure is up.
<br>
<br>
There are eight facilities on campus that provide
<br>
housing in exchange for animal husbandry, giving
<br>
students the opportunity to work with cows, pigs,
<br>
goats, horses, birds and sheep.

“When I meet new people, I tell them
<br>
I live in an actual red barn with white
<br>
trim,” said Pedro Martinez, an animal
<br>
science junior who resides at
<br>
the sheep barn with two other
<br>
interns. “It’s a conversation ice
<br>
breaker. I tell them it’s like
<br>
being a resident advisor, only
<br>
for sheep, not students.”
<br>
Martinez, who grew up
<br>
in Porterville, California,
<br>
plans to become a livestock
<br>
veterinarian and learns on the
<br>
job by shadowing and assisting
<br>
veterinarians at the barn.

Late-night deliveries
<br>
The sheep barn, the dairy and other campus
<br>
animal facilities also give Martinez, Greenhut
<br>
and other student residents ample opportunity
<br>
to get hands-on experience with livestock
<br>
reproduction and births.
<br>
<br>
“Animals normally don’t give birth between
<br>
8 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon when the
<br>
barn manager is around,” said Dan Sehnert, who
<br>
oversees all animal facilities on campus that are
<br>
managed by the Department of Animal Science.
<br>
<br>
“These animals give birth in the middle of the
<br>
are just going to bed, animal science major Teresa
<br>
Greenhut is feeding cows. It’s 4 a.m.—one of four
<br>
times a day that the herd gets fed at the UC Davis
<br>
Dairy Teaching and Research Center. Greenhut
<br>
awakens before dawn in her dairy dorm room,
<br>
bundles up, puts on a headlamp and rubber muck
<br>
boots, and heads out to the barn to shovel feed.
<br>
<br>
As a student resident at the dairy barn,
<br>
Greenhut takes the 4 a.m. feeding shift a couple
<br>
of days a week as part of her internship duties.
<br>
<br>
In exchange for 10 hours a week of work, student
<br>
residents get free housing at the dairy.
<br>
<br>
No, not in the stalls. In dorm rooms much like
<br>
any other, though the doors are decorated with a
<br>
black and white pattern like a Holstein, and the
<br>
rooms are located just a few feet away from the
<br>
milking parlor. Greenhut is one of four students
<br>
who live at the dairy to help keep things running
<br>
when facility manager Doug Gisi goes home at
<br>
night. “There are many ways to get experience with
<br>
animals on campus, but the barn residency
<br>
is much more in-depth,” said Greenhut, a
<br>
sophomore from Wilton, California, who was
<br>
involved with livestock through FFA in high
<br>
school. “You really get a taste for managing
<br>
a herd.”

cost of college, and the herds get round-the-clock
<br>
supervision. “Being a resident has helped me meet lots of people
<br>
and make connections in industry,” said Martinez.
<br>
<br>
“When I go to a conference, people already know
<br>
my name, and they know I’m a resident at the
<br>
UC Davis sheep barn.”

To vet school, industry and beyond
<br>
Former animal science students who were barn
<br>
residents have gone on to careers in veterinary
<br>
medicine, the livestock industry, as well as
<br>
dentistry, firefighting and more. Sehnert
<br>
considers the program good for everyone
<br>
involved—students get experience,

night. So our barn residents are the ones who are assisting
<br>
and seeing it through, or calling for help in emergencies.”
<br>
At the sheep barn, lambing season runs from about
<br>
October through February, but most of the babies are born
<br>
in November, when sheep barn residents might handle up
<br>
to a dozen births per night. “Some of the first-time mothers
<br>
are lousy moms,” said Martinez. “So we put the mother
<br>
and the lamb in a small pen together where they can bond.
<br>
<br>
We make sure the lambs are getting milk, because the first
<br>
milk has lots of antibodies that help protect the babies
<br>
from infection.”
<br>
Midwifing during the wee hours can make it hard to
<br>
get up for classes the next day, but barn residents think
<br>
the experience is worth it. “It’s definitely rewarding,” said
<br>
Greenhut, who has spent many sleepless nights helping
<br>
cows give birth at the dairy. “But you need to know what
<br>
you’re in for.”
