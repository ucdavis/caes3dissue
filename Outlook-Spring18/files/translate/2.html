<br>
Experiential education prepares students for brighter future for all of us
<br>
AT THE COLLEGE of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences (CA&ES), our students get their hands
<br>
dirty. They learn by doing in laboratories,
<br>
greenhouses, farms, barns, wineries, nature
<br>
reserves and creeks. They receive world-
<br>
class academics and experiential learning
<br>
opportunities that prepare them for rewarding
<br>
careers and fulfilling lives.
<br>
<br>
And that’s not all. A CA&ES education
<br>
empowers students to become full partners in
<br>
finding innovative solutions for feeding the planet’s
<br>
growing population while promoting sound
<br>
environmental practices and healthy communities.
<br>
<br>
On campus, students work with community
<br>
partners designing gardens, for example, and
<br>
improving space for underrepresented youth.
<br>
<br>
Some students breed crops and study soil at the
<br>
Student Farm and Russell Ranch, while others
<br>
harness cellular and biomolecular processes in
<br>
labs or restore wildlife habitats along Putah Creek.
<br>
<br>
Off campus, our students venture farther
<br>
afield. Some find internships with help from
<br>
family, faculty or alumni. Others make industry
<br>
connections through college stakeholders.
<br>
<br>
Plant science students who attend monthly
<br>
Seed Central meetings learn about job opportunities
<br>
with companies such as HM.Clause and May
<br>
Seed. Students in managerial economics have
<br>
interned with companies like Morgan Stanley
<br>
and LinkedIn. Our human ecology students learn
<br>
on the job with CalPIRG, the California Energy
<br>
Commission and Kaiser Permanente. Clinical
<br>
nutrition students find experiential learning
<br>
opportunities with companies such as Rite Aid
<br>
Pharmacy and nonprofit organizations like the
<br>
Elderly Nutrition Program. Our viticulture
<br>
and enology students find internships with
<br>
winemakers in California and beyond.
<br>
<br>
The Internship and Career Center offers
<br>
UC Davis students a wealth of resources like job
<br>
listings, resume guidance and interview tips. The
<br>
ICC helps our students land internships with
<br>
companies and groups such as Pacific Star Farms,
<br>
Cache Creek Conservancy and the Yolo Basin
<br>
Foundation. Incoming CA&ES students can join
<br>
the Career Discovery Program offered through
<br>
the college to explore potential careers.
<br>
<br>
Any student can join clubs and organizations
<br>
affiliated with professions, such as the Food Tech
<br>
Club, the student chapter of the American Society
<br>
of Landscape Architects and the Biotechnology
<br>
Club. They also earn units for interning with
<br>
a faculty member or by enrolling in a specific
<br>
program like UC Center Sacramento.
<br>
<br>
Experiential learning opportunities prepare
<br>
students for a fulfilling future for themselves and
<br>
society. The critical issues we face in agriculture,
<br>
the environment and human heath are not
<br>
theoretical. Our students graduate with the
<br>
practical knowledge, experience and passion to
<br>
help produce a better world, healthier lives and
<br>
an improved standard of living for us all.
