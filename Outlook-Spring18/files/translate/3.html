CA&ES STUDENTS ARE ON THE JOB —whether
<br>
managing livestock, reimagining food brands
<br>
using natural colors, distributing crops
<br>
to customers across the nation, collecting
<br>
atmospheric samples for NASA or tracking fish in
<br>
the wild. On and off campus, our students build
<br>
practical knowledge to become full partners in
<br>
finding innovative solutions to critical issues in
<br>
agriculture, the environment and human health.
