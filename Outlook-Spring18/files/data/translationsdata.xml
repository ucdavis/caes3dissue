		<paragraph><![CDATA[“It looks like prenatal stress can be good for us if we are ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[said Sarah Hartman, a newly minted Ph.D. graduate in human ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[of human development professor Jay Belsky and psychology ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[journal Psychological Science. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[PRENATAL STRESS MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD FOR BABIES ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[TESTING STRESS ON PRAIRIE VOLES ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Most experts believe prenatal stress is harmful to children’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[development because children of mothers who experience ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[stressors like domestic violence or poverty during pregnancy ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[are more likely to develop behavioral difficulties such as ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. But is prenatal stress ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[really to blame? ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Often times, the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[same conditions that ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[led to prenatal stress are ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[present after the baby is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[born, so it may be the continuation of stress that accounts for ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[poor functioning later in life,” Hartman said. “We explored ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[whether prenatal stress—rather than leading to certain ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[outcomes—influences a child’s sensitivity to postnatal care, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[for better and for worse.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Evidence shows that babies whose mothers experienced ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[high levels of stress in pregnancy tend to be more emotionally ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and physiologically reactive to their environment—they are ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[often harder to soothe and more easily distressed, for example. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Science also indicates that those very characteristics lead ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[children to develop more poorly in negative environments but ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[progress better than others when reared in supportive homes. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Of course, it wouldn’t be ethical to stress pregnant women ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to test the resulting proposition that prenatal stress promotes ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[susceptibility to postnatal experiences,” Belsky said. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[So the team tested their theory with 78 pregnant prairie ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[voles, a rodent with human-like qualities such as the ability to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[develop emotional attachments. For 10 minutes a day during ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the last week of pregnancy, the team placed half of the voles ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[in visual contact with an aggressive female vole—a stressful ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[situation for a pregnant vole. The other half did not experience ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that stress. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Within 24 hours of birth, the team placed all the newborn ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[voles with adoptive parents, half who were known to be ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[attentive caregivers and half who were negligent. After 75 ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[days, the voles were evaluated for anxious behavior and levels ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of the stress hormone corticosterone. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The results were striking and unequivocal, Belsky said. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“The voles that experienced prenatal stress proved to be the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[most and least anxious adults ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[depending on the quality of their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[postnatal care,” Belsky said. “The ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[voles that didn’t experience prenatal ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[stress fell somewhere in between, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and it made no difference whether ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[they had good or bad parents.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[NEXT STEPS ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Belsky and Hartman are not recommending women ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[increase their levels of stress during pregnancy, of course. ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[recently established an endowed scholarship ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Of all my life experiences, attending ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[could do more than that. You ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[should think about going to medical school.’” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Lamberti hadn’t planned on that much ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Professor Pfieffer truly wanted to guide us and ]]></paragraph>
