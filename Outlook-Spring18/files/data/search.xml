Experiential education prepares students for brighter future for all of us AT THE COLLEGE of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (CA&ES), our students get their hands dirty. They learn by doing in laboratories, greenhouses, farms, barns, wineries, nature reserves and creeks. They receive world- class academics and experiential learning opportunities that prepare them for rewarding careers and fulfilling lives. And that’s not all. A CA&ES education empowers students to become full partners in finding innovative solutions for feeding the planet’s growing population while promoting sound environmental practices and healthy communities. On campus, students work with community partners designing gardens, for example, and improving space for underrepresented youth. Some students breed crops and study soil at the Student Farm and Russell Ranch, while others harness cellular and biomolecular processes in labs or restore wildlife habitats along Putah Creek. Off campus, our students venture farther afield. Some find internships with help from family, faculty or alumni. Others make industry connections through college stakeholders. Plant science students who attend monthly Seed Central meetings learn about job opportunities with companies such as HM.Clause and May Seed. Students in managerial economics have interned with companies like Morgan Stanley and LinkedIn. Our human ecology students learn on the job with CalPIRG, the California Energy Commission and Kaiser Permanente. Clinical nutrition students find experiential learning opportunities with companies such as Rite Aid Pharmacy and nonprofit organizations like the Elderly Nutrition Program. Our viticulture and enology students find internships with winemakers in California and beyond. The Internship and Career Center offers UC Davis students a wealth of resources like job listings, resume guidance and interview tips. The ICC helps our students land internships with companies and groups such as Pacific Star Farms, Cache Creek Conservancy and the Yolo Basin Foundation. Incoming CA&ES students can join the Career Discovery Program offered through the college to explore potential careers. Any student can join clubs and organizations affiliated with professions, such as the Food Tech Club, the student chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects and the Biotechnology Club. They also earn units for interning with a faculty member or by enrolling in a specific program like UC Center Sacramento. Experiential learning opportunities prepare students for a fulfilling future for themselves and society. The critical issues we face in agriculture, the environment and human heath are not theoretical. Our students graduate with the practical knowledge, experience and passion to help produce a better world, healthier lives and an improved standard of living for us all.

The first part of the paid internship was at NASA Armstrong, located near Edwards Air Force Base in southern California. After a couple of weeks of instrument training and preparation, students boarded flights to collect samples of atmospheric gases. Next Huber’s group made a road trip to collect air samples from national parks at Joshua Tree and Sequoia, wilderness areas plagued by poor air quality. The rest of the summer was spent at UC Irvine, where the NASA interns analyzed data from their samples and prepared research presentations.

OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2017 who is studying for a master’s degree in international agricultural development, recently spent six months in Uganda helping smallholder farmers improve irrigation practices with an approach that went beyond technology development. “I was searching for an opportunity to work on a project in East Africa that focused on gender, social equity and engaged directly with farmers,” she said. “My interest is in helping develop practical solutions in a collaborative, sustainable and community-focused way.” Jordan became a fellow with the Research and Innovation Fellowship for Agriculture (RIFA) in 2017. RIFA is designed to give graduate students throughout the UC system an opportunity to plan, engage and implement projects in developing countries. Through this program, Jordan teamed up with soil science professor Kate Scow, who oversees an irrigation improvement project in eastern Uganda that is funded by the Horticulture Innovation Lab at UC Davis. Called the Horticulture Irrigation Project (HIP), it seeks to facilitate development of farmer-led irrigation solutions through participatory methods. Jordan worked closely with the Teso Women Development Initiative (TEWDI), a nongovernmental community organization addressing poverty in Uganda, to explore how gender and other social factors constrain or encourage farmer participation. Through in-depth interviews, project records review and focus group analysis, her goal is to define what makes participation meaningful in the development of irrigation systems. “This work helped me focus my interests and expand my understanding of both small- scale irrigation and the realities of participatory development,” she said. “I didn’t want to just look at the differences between women and men farmers. I wanted to explore how gender norms and dynamics intersect with age, marital status and other social factors to influence how farmers access irrigation technologies.” HIP already had a strong focus on gender when Jordan arrived. The farmer irrigation committees are required to have at least 50 percent women members, and women are also JULIA JORDAN, A UC DAVIS STUDENT ]]></page>

Feedback on the effectiveness of irrigation innovations includes both mixed-gender and women-only focus groups. “Participation in this process encouraged many women to become engaged in trainings usually considered the domain of men,” Jordan says. Her work with female and male crop science, agricultural mechanization and engineering students from Busitema University was particularly rewarding. Jordan led workshops where students, many of them from rural farm families and villages throughout Uganda, were asked to examine assumptions about gender roles in agriculture and in the home. For instance, why is it that women tend to collect firewood and water, while men are more likely to manage cattle. “These students started thinking about gender issues they had never considered before,” she said. “They started to think how they could engineer a tool or encourage a new practice that will be accessible to farmers across gender, age, cultural beliefs, physical ability and other factors.” Busitema students, interns and project assistants played a significant role in the development of low-cost, easy-to-use, small-scale irrigation technologies for the six vegetable- growing sites in the HIP project. They work directly alongside farmers and other project team members in the fields, putting into practice what they learn in the classroom to design and implement innovations such as a zero-energy water wheel pump, a low-cost land leveling tool and an efficient canal system. “While I had knowledge of gender in agriculture prior to my time in Uganda, being able to observe and practice how to realistically address gender in the implementation of an agricultural development project was probably the most valuable experience for me,” said Jordan, who is now back in Davis analyzing her research. She has written about her experiences on Agrilinks.org, an online community for food security and agricultural development practitioners. “In order for farmers to develop sustainable, appropriate irrigation systems in Uganda, the researchers and practitioners who support them need the language and tools to address gender and other social dynamics,” Jordan said. “A young generation of irrigation engineers and scientists is now engaged in a process of positive social change and gender equity through irrigation design.” • Building support for RIFA The Research and Innovation Fellowship for Agriculture was originally funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and is currently supported by the University of California Global Food Initiative. The CA&ES International Programs Office is committed to building an endowment that will make the program sustainable by 2020. This effort has already begun with the generous support of Rita and James Seiber. James Seiber is UC Davis Professor Emeritus of Environmental Toxicology.

Some students design school gardens, for example, or redesign a space for youth programs in low-income housing. The class, LDA 141, is very hands-on. And to be honest, going into it, some students are wary. “I was hesitant at first,” said Terence Wu, who participated in LDA 141 in 2017, the year he graduated with a degree in sustainable environmental design. “It didn’t seem like it would be that easy for an introvert like me. I just liked to do the sketching and concept design.” But something magical happened for Wu and many other students who have taken the course since human ecology professor Sheryl-Ann Simpson started teaching it five years ago.

You can help reduce obesity, for example, by integrating healthy food sources into neighborhoods.” In LDA 141, Davis worked in Sacramento with Mercy Housing California, which revitalizes neighborhoods by providing safe, quality, service-enriched housing. Davis’ team helped turn a small, dilapidated room into an inviting space where young people could gather after school to talk, play games and explore ways to solve problems in their community. “It was just an old junk room with boarded up windows, and Warwin’s group helped us reimagine it,” said Ashlei Hurst, associate director of resident services for Mercy Housing who received her master’s degree in community development from UC Davis in 2015. “They surveyed 100 youths and came up with very cool concepts on how to design the space.” LDA 141 students continue to work with Mercy Housing, and the benefits extend beyond improving physical space. “Sheryl-Ann’s classes get out into the community and work directly with our students,” Hurst said. “Her classes tend to be diverse, and it’s good for our students to see people who look like them go to college and be successful.” The garden grows Environmental design graduate Terence Wu has long appreciated the power of plants. When he was enrolled in LDA 141, Wu and five other students worked with staff and students at Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School in Davis to plant a native garden. “Some of us designed the maps, others helped the school refine its grant proposal for the project and others worked with students to paint signs so the garden could be a community effort that was educational, ecologically beneficial and visually appealing.” Each year, the garden grows.

Altschuld is now coaching soccer for college and youth teams and working as a research specialist in Simpson’s lab. She’s not sure what her next career step will be, but she will take it with confidence. “That’s what I learned most from Sheryl- Ann—that I have the power to affect change,” Altschuld said. “I’m an athlete and have been in leadership roles, but this class empowered me to own my knowledge and experience in a professional setting.” Wu has gone on to work in urban forestry in West Sacramento and in the city of Davis and also currently directs Project Invigorate, a group of volunteers and student interns who renew drought-tolerant landscapes in the community. He is no longer hesitant about working in the community. “The class connected me with real-world experience, and taught me how rewarding community projects can be,” Wu said. “Her classes tend to be diverse, and it’s good for our students to see people who look like them go to college and be successful.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 11 ]]></page>

There are eight facilities on campus that provide housing in exchange for animal husbandry, giving students the opportunity to work with cows, pigs, goats, horses, birds and sheep. 14 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2018 “When I meet new people, I tell them I live in an actual red barn with white trim,” said Pedro Martinez, an animal science junior who resides at the sheep barn with two other interns. “It’s a conversation ice breaker.

I tell them it’s like being a resident advisor, only for sheep, not students.” Late-night deliveries The sheep barn, the dairy and other campus animal facilities also give Martinez, Greenhut and other student residents ample opportunity to get hands-on experience with livestock reproduction and births. “Animals normally don’t give birth between 8 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon when the barn manager is around,” said Dan Sehnert, who oversees all animal facilities on campus that are managed by the Department of Animal Science. “These animals give birth in the middle of the are just going to bed, animal science major Teresa Greenhut is feeding cows. It’s 4 a.m.—one of four times a day that the herd gets fed at the UC Davis Dairy Teaching and Research Center. Greenhut awakens before dawn in her dairy dorm room, bundles up, puts on a headlamp and rubber muck boots, and heads out to the barn to shovel feed. As a student resident at the dairy barn, Greenhut takes the 4 a.m. feeding shift a couple of days a week as part of her internship duties.

So our barn residents are the ones who are assisting and seeing it through, or calling for help in emergencies.” At the sheep barn, lambing season runs from about October through February, but most of the babies are born in November, when sheep barn residents might handle up to a dozen births per night. “Some of the first-time mothers are lousy moms,” said Martinez. “So we put the mother and the lamb in a small pen together where they can bond. We make sure the lambs are getting milk, because the first milk has lots of antibodies that help protect the babies from infection.” Midwifing during the wee hours can make it hard to get up for classes the next day, but barn residents think the experience is worth it. “It’s definitely rewarding,” said Greenhut, who has spent many sleepless nights helping cows give birth at the dairy. “But you need to know what you’re in for.” ]]></page>

	<page pageNumber="19"><![CDATA[after all, depending on how they are raised. New research from child development scholars at UC Davis suggests that prenatal stress promotes developmental plasticity in babies, making them especially likely to benefit from good parenting as well as suffer from negligent care. “It looks like prenatal stress can be good for us if we are lucky enough to have a supportive environment postnatally,” said Sarah Hartman, a newly minted Ph.D. graduate in human ecology who conducted the research under the supervision of human development professor Jay Belsky and psychology professor Karen Bales. “Most notably, our research challenges the prevailing view that prenatal stress undermines children’s health and development,” said Belsky, the holder of the Robert M. and Natalie Reid Dorn Endowed Chair on Infancy. Hartman, Belsky and Bales’ work appeared recently in the journal Psychological Science. PRENATAL STRESS MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD FOR BABIES TESTING STRESS ON PRAIRIE VOLES Most experts believe prenatal stress is harmful to children’s development because children of mothers who experience stressors like domestic violence or poverty during pregnancy are more likely to develop behavioral difficulties such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. But is prenatal stress really to blame? “Often times, the same conditions that led to prenatal stress are present after the baby is born, so it may be the continuation of stress that accounts for poor functioning later in life,” Hartman said. “We explored whether prenatal stress—rather than leading to certain outcomes—influences a child’s sensitivity to postnatal care, for better and for worse.” Evidence shows that babies whose mothers experienced high levels of stress in pregnancy tend to be more emotionally and physiologically reactive to their environment—they are often harder to soothe and more easily distressed, for example. Science also indicates that those very characteristics lead children to develop more poorly in negative environments but progress better than others when reared in supportive homes. “Of course, it wouldn’t be ethical to stress pregnant women to test the resulting proposition that prenatal stress promotes susceptibility to postnatal experiences,” Belsky said. So the team tested their theory with 78 pregnant prairie voles, a rodent with human-like qualities such as the ability to develop emotional attachments. For 10 minutes a day during the last week of pregnancy, the team placed half of the voles in visual contact with an aggressive female vole—a stressful situation for a pregnant vole. The other half did not experience that stress. Within 24 hours of birth, the team placed all the newborn voles with adoptive parents, half who were known to be attentive caregivers and half who were negligent. After 75 days, the voles were evaluated for anxious behavior and levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. The results were striking and unequivocal, Belsky said. “The voles that experienced prenatal stress proved to be the most and least anxious adults depending on the quality of their postnatal care,” Belsky said. “The voles that didn’t experience prenatal stress fell somewhere in between, and it made no difference whether they had good or bad parents.” NEXT STEPS Belsky and Hartman are not recommending women increase their levels of stress during pregnancy, of course. And there is still a lot to learn about the biological mechanisms that increased the stressed voles’ sensitivity to postnatal care. But the findings could relieve anxiety for women who experience temporary stressful situations during pregnancy. “Prenatal stress might actually promote child wellbeing when children are reared in supportive environments,” Belsky said. • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 17 ]]></page>

GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis Wood ducks give students a 18 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2018 largely been lost in California due to development. Fortunately, the birds are adaptive and will nest in manmade wooden boxes that simulate a tree cavity. Most wildlife students intern during the spring quarter, when ducklings are hatching. Bailey Higa—a recent wildlife, fish and conser- vation biology graduate now working at Wildlife Associates in Half Moon Bay—interned for two quarters during her undergraduate years. “The wood duck experience is really great for learning how to collect accurate data in the field,” said Higa. “We were outside the whole time, and we had to carry all our instruments with us and work in different weather conditions.” To provide duck habitat, several generous Sacramento-area landowners have spent millions restoring former agricultural fields to native wetlands along the Pacific Flyway. The owners of Bird Haven Ranch, Roosevelt Ranch, Conaway Ranch and Hedgerow Farms allow Eadie to erect nest boxes and monitor wood duck activity on their lands. The research is funded by the National Science Foundation. —Robin DeRieux To view more photos of wood ducks and student interns, visit caes.ucdavis.edu/news/WoodDucks. experience are known among students majoring in wildlife, fish and conservation biology as the wildlife model for an internship program run by Professor John Eadie. Each year, from 50 to 90 interns learn how to check nests, measure eggs, band birds, collect blood samples and conduct field research on waterfowl behavior, reproduction and survival. Over the course of nearly two decades, Eadie has led the wood duck internship for hundreds of students seeking hands-on experience. “It’s a remarkable opportunity for undergraduates to learn field biology in our own backyard,” said Eadie, who holds the Raveling Endowed Professorship in Waterfowl Biology. “For many, it’s the first time they’ve ever handled a wild bird. The impact is transformational.” Known for their showy plumage, wood ducks also have unusual reproductive behavior. Female wood ducks lay eggs in multiple nests, though why is not fully understood. Are they sneaky and duplicitous, hoping to get another female to do the hard work of incubating and raising off- spring? Or are they communal and cooperative, helping to raise the offspring of close relatives? To answer these questions and more, Eadie and his research team put tiny transponders in the birds (like the identification chip that vet- erinarians use for pets) and erect scanners at each nest site. Wood ducks prefer to nest in tree hollows along native waterways, which have AT UC DAVIS, WOOD DUCKS ]]></page>

The guy was Parker Reuter, a colleague of Baljeu’s uncle who heard Derek was studying winemaking at UC Davis. Reuter was versed in the business aspect of starting a company and needed help with wine production. Baljeu had hoped to one day create his own wine label, so he found the idea intriguing. “We talked, and I said, ‘Yes, this is awesome, please include me.’” Six months later, Color Wine was born. Baljeu used the contacts, science and hands-on training he received at UC Davis to help the company secure grapes from Alexander Valley, line up a production facility in Healdsburg and dial in the right blend to create a label geared especially for millennials. “We have a Chardonnay, red blend and rosé that are super light and fun to drink,” Baljeu says. “It’s a wine you can put on ice and enjoy at, say, a pool party.” Color Wine is available online and served at restaurants and wine bars throughout Southern California and beyond. Baljeu initially thought he would study business when he started at UC Davis in 2013, but a winemaking class turned his head. “I liked the organic chemistry and microbiology—I’m kind of a nerd—as well as the marketing and social science aspects of viticulture and enology,” Baljeu says. Thanks to two winery internships and his undergraduate education, Baljeu gleaned a great overview of the art and science of making wine. And he did it all while playing fullback and tight end for the UC Davis Aggies football team. “Every Saturday night when we had an away game, I would be typing away on the plane ride back and be up until 4 o’clock in the morning to finish my assignments,” Baljeu remembers. “It wasn’t easy.” But it was worth it. “The program taught me both the how and why of winemaking, which is why I could say yes when Parker called,” Baljeu says. Baljeu is now working on his master’s degree in viticulture and enology at UC Davis. He hopes to one day become a winemaker of high-end wines. —Diane Nelson Watch a video of Derek’s experience at bit.ly/DerekBaljeu.

We would go everywhere. We spent a lot of time snowboarding in Canada and at Lake Tahoe.” Camboia passed away in 2015, and Quinn wanted to memorialize his friend. So he reached out to their alma mater and decided to contribute to the “Adopt an Acre” program at Russell Ranch, a research farm west of campus. “The Camboias are farmers from Gustine, so this gift seemed to resonate with his life and his background,” Quinn said. “He never forgot where he came from. It just seemed like a very fitting tribute to Dave and his family.” A one-acre research section of the century- long sustainability experiment at Russell Ranch now bears Camboia’s name. Quinn, who heads up a global information systems department at Apple Inc., graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor’s degree in political science. He has many fond memories from his time as a student athlete and all the friends, coaches, educators and other mentors who influenced his life. “It was an honor to attend UC Davis and to have the experiences that I did,” Quinn said. “I look at my life today and I wouldn’t change a thing. I feel very fortunate.” Over the years, Quinn has found many ways to stay involved. He has been a board member of the Cal Aggie Alumni Association and an ex-officio trustee of the UC Davis Foundation Board. He also has financially supported programs such as the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, the Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, the UC Davis Athletic department and the MIND Institute. “Over time I’ve tried to give back as much as possible, so as opportunities arose I would take them,” Quinn said. “Dave was a dear friend and a really wonderful guy. Part of me wants to make sure his name echoes out there as long as possible.” A proud Aggie, Quinn encourages his fellow alumni to engage with their alma mater: join the alumni association, reconnect with a department, contact the career center or seek out other opportunities. “UC Davis is one of the top public universities in the country. If there are parts of UC Davis you believe in and care about, just do it,” Quinn said. “Every little bit helps—and it creates a pattern of giving. I say, just start.” —John Stumbos DeWayne Quinn (top) adopted an acre at the UC Davis Russell Ranch research farm to honor his late friend and fellow student athlete David Camboia (below).

But several faculty members saw her potential and encouraged her to dream big. Now, after concluding a successful career as a medical doctor, she is taking stock and choosing to give back to the university that created so much opportunity for her. Lamberti recently established an endowed scholarship for students majoring in global disease biology, environmental science and management or wildlife, fish and conservation biology. “Of all my life experiences, attending UC Davis was the most pivotal influence,” she said. “To give today’s students the same opportunities we had is one of the greatest gifts we can give.” When Lamberti was beginning her education at UC Davis, a bacteriology instructor— Professor Wiltraud Pfieffer— “Of all my life experiences, asked about her career plans. “I mentioned laboratory science or attending UC Davis was the medical technology,” Lamberti said. “She told me, ‘I think you most pivotal influence.” could do more than that. You should think about going to medical school.’” Lamberti hadn’t planned on that much additional education, but the idea was planted. “Professor Pfieffer truly wanted to guide us and encourage us to do the most that we could: to shoot high rather than to shoot for something comfortable.” Pfieffer referred her to animal physiology professor Harry Colvin, who also became a valued mentor—and faculty advisor. After earning her bachelor’s degree, she considered pursuing a Ph.D. with Colvin and possibly a career in veterinary medicine. But the calling to become a physician was strong, so she was thrilled when she was accepted into medical school at UC San Francisco. “I’m the first person in my family to go into 24 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2018 PAUL KURODA PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE MANY COLLEGE FRESHMEN , Alumna Judy Lamberti established an endowed scholarship for UC Davis students majoring in global disease biology, environmental science and management or wildlife, fish and conservation biology. medicine,” Lamberti said. “My parents were just thrilled that my brother and I were good students and wanted to go to college. And we went to a place that didn’t break the bank.” Lamberti already included UC Davis in her estate plans but wanted to do more. She chose areas to support that reflect her own passions. “It’s about health, and at the root of our health is our environment,” she said. Dr. Lamberti encourages her fellow alumni to help provide support for the next generation. “If students are willing to work hard, they deserve the opportunity to go to school,” she said. “These young people are the future. I want them to get a great education. I want them to go to UC Davis.” —John Stumbos ]]></page>
