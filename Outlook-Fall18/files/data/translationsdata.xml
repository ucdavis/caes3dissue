		<paragraph><![CDATA[collaborative agricultural research. The University of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[California created our campus more than a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[century ago as a model farm to improve ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[agricultural science, instruction and production. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Working together with our partners, our college ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[has made agricultural discoveries that have ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[fundamentally changed the way we grow, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[harvest, process, store and enjoy our food. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[We can’t do it alone. Our college faculty ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and student researchers work side by side with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[farmers, industry representatives, government ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[agencies and others to develop innovations and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[management strategies to increase agricultural ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[production while protecting our environment ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and supporting healthy communities. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Scientists need input and support from the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[agricultural industry from start to finish: to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[know what issues to address, to find working ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[landscapes to conduct their experiments and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to help circulate findings back to the field. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Although farmers face inconvenience and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[possible loss of production when they open up ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[their land to researchers, they do it to benefit ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[consumers and the entire industry. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Take, for example, a recent experiment with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[walnuts and irrigation management. Growers ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[were concerned that their trees were exhibiting ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[unusual symptoms like yellowing leaves and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[increased disease susceptibility. Researchers ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[suspected the walnut trees were receiving too ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[much water early in the season. To test their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[theory, they needed access to an orchard for at ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[least five years. A walnut grower in Red Bluff ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[volunteered his land and managed his own ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[irrigation and treatment around the needs and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[timing of university researchers. The study’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[results—which you can read about on page 12— ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[could greatly improve walnut yield and quality, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and now the Red Bluff grower is sharing that ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[valuable information with fellow farmers. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Similar stories abound in fields, orchards, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[farms and vineyards throughout the state. ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[more than 40 years. He stays up-to-date on the latest science ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and invests in technology that keeps his farming sustainable. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[He uses precision technology to apply nitrogen, for example, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that essentially spoon-feeds water and nutrients to his trees. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Our yields have increased quite a bit since we switched ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to precision application,” says Bowman, adjusting his hat ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[against the noonday sun. “And that’s without adding any ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[extra nitrogen. That’s huge.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Besides almonds, Bowman has something else developing ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[in this fertile field—nitrogen efficiency research. A team ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of UC Davis experts has installed one tower, 20 wells and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[many yards of tubes on Bowman’s farm to measure the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[complete nitrogen cycle—what goes in and what goes out. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The uniquely interactive project will shed light on perhaps ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the most pressing question in agriculture today: How do ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[we nourish the crops that feed us without harming the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[environment in which we live? ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“It’s about balance,” says UC Davis plant physiology ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[professor Patrick Brown, standing beside Bowman beneath a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[tree. “When we work together to understand the science and the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[constraints, we can design a system that maximizes nitrogen ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[efficiency and minimizes impact on the environment.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[ART BOWMAN HAS BEEN GROWING ALMONDS ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Why nitrogen matters ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[All plants need nitrogen to grow. Nitrogen is vital ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to producing high-yield crops to feed billions of people ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[worldwide. But excess nutrients can pollute air and drinking ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[water and cause serious health and environmental risks. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Every crop has different nutrient needs, and even those ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[requirements vary based on factors such as soil type, weather, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[irrigation and how much nitrogen crops can access from ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[organic matter in the soil. Crops suffer if they don’t get ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[enough nitrogen, but too much is bad, too. Excess nutrients ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[can leach into groundwater, which many Californians depend ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[on for drinking water. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[It’s hard to track the timing and source of pollutants in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[groundwater. Pollutants can leach down from farms and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[dairies, and also from industrial uses, such as gas stations. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[It can take years and even decades to detect nitrogen in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[a drinking-water well, so it can be difficult to evaluate ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[groundwater impacts from current farming practices. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[A changing landscape ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Nitrogen use has changed dramatically in California. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Forty years ago, farmers generally applied a year’s worth of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[fertilizer at the start of the season. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We’d broadcast it out and hope for the rains to come,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Bowman remembers. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The rains did come, and too often washed away excess ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nutrients or leached them below the root zone. As Brown ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[says, “It’s like feeding your pigs all their food all at once and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[expecting any to still be there at the end of the year.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[These days, most farmers apply smaller amounts of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nitrogen throughout the season. UC Davis researchers ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[have created online resources such as the California ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Fertilization Guidelines to help farmers ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[But that’s not how it works, the study shows. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Instead, trees that grow in saturated soil early ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[sort of like taking a human’s blood pressure— ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[which is a much more accurate way to measure a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[plant’s water needs.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[For the last five years, the team has been ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[applying different water treatments to five ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[blocks of trees. One block is getting standard, ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[begin irrigating the other blocks when the trees ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[to start irrigating? ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Department of Plant Sciences. “Trees end up ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[with a very shallow root system, which doesn’t ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[serve them well as they try to extract moisture ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from the soil later on.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Lampinen has long suspected that walnuts ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[were getting too much water in the spring. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“A lot of the symptoms we see like yellowing ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[leaves and various diseases can all be explained ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[by overwatering,” Lampinen says. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[So Lampinen did what scientists do: He set ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[up an experiment. Five years ago, with funding ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from the California Walnut Board and the U.S. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Department of Agriculture, he joined forces with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[plant sciences professor Ken Shackel and UC ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Cooperative Extension irrigation advisor Allan ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Fulton. Together, they led a team of scientists ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[testing irrigation on Crain’s ranch. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Hal is an exceptional partner,” says UC farm ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[advisor Allan Fulton. “Farmers have a lot to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[accommodate when they host an experiment ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[like this, with researchers going in and out ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of the orchard at all hours. He had to work ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[around our people and the timing of our water ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[treatments. He’s always eager to experiment ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[with technology and learn new things, and he ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[shares what he learns with other growers. Hal ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[completes the circle.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[So, when is the best time to start irrigating? ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[To answer that question, researchers ask the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[trees. They use pressure chambers, which are ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[doing the best. Their irrigation usually starts in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[mid-to-late June, several weeks later than when ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[standard watering begins. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“You can tell just by looking at that block ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that the trees are healthier,” Crain says, standing ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[beneath a canopy of lush, green trees. “And, we’re ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[seeing greater yields and better nut quality.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Translating the research ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The study is helping researchers and Crain ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[advise farmers on irrigation. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“My biggest takeaway is that when you start ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[watering is a really important factor to the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[health of your trees,” Lampinen says. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Pressure chambers—sometimes called ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[pressure bombs—can cost more than $3,000, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and high-tech versions are in development. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“I tell growers a pressure bomb would pay ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[for itself even if you just used it once a year to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[determine when to start watering,” Lampinen says. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Crain is certainly convinced. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“When you irrigate based on your trees’ ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[needs, you optimize water,” Crain says. “I’m ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[not using less water overall, but the water I do ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[use is producing more food. That’s good news ]]></paragraph>
