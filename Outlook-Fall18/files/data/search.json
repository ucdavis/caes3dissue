Rustici Rangeland and Cattle Research Endowment. From the Dean Partnerships support agricultural discoveries and productivity UC DAVIS HAS A RICH HISTORY of collaborative agricultural research. The University of California created our campus more than a century ago as a model farm to improve agricultural science, instruction and production. Working together with our partners, our college has made agricultural discoveries that have fundamentally changed the way we grow, harvest, process, store and enjoy our food. We can’t do it alone. Our college faculty and student researchers work side by side with farmers, industry representatives, government agencies and others to develop innovations and management strategies to increase agricultural production while protecting our environment and supporting healthy communities. Scientists need input and support from the agricultural industry from start to finish: to know what issues to address, to find working landscapes to conduct their experiments and to help circulate findings back to the field. Although farmers face inconvenience and possible loss of production when they open up their land to researchers, they do it to benefit consumers and the entire industry. Take, for example, a recent experiment with walnuts and irrigation management. Growers were concerned that their trees were exhibiting unusual symptoms like yellowing leaves and increased disease susceptibility. Researchers suspected the walnut trees were receiving too much water early in the season. To test their theory, they needed access to an orchard for at least five years. A walnut grower in Red Bluff volunteered his land and managed his own irrigation and treatment around the needs and timing of university researchers. The study’s results—which you can read about on page 12— could greatly improve walnut yield and quality, and now the Red Bluff grower is sharing that valuable information with fellow farmers. Similar stories abound in fields, orchards, farms and vineyards throughout the state. Our faculty, staff and students are partnering with farmers and others to enhance nitrogen efficiency, breed better cattle, build healthy soil, mechanize wine grape cultivation, welcome a new generation of ranchers, adopt energy- efficient food systems and so much more. Farmers in our state produce about half of the produce and nuts grown in the U.S. and nearly a quarter of the nation’s milk and cream. California is the only major U.S. supplier of tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, almonds, walnuts, pistachios, grapes, olives, figs and many other crops. Agricultural production and discoveries in California can impact the entire world. As agriculture faces many challenges, we rigorously collaborate to find ways to feed a growing population in the face of variable weather, dwindling natural resources and a shrinking labor supply. Together with our many partners, I am confident we can develop solutions to keep agriculture productive, profitable and sustainable now and into the future. ROBIN DERIEUX/UC Davis ",

Breeding Beans UC Davis researchers have begun field studies on a rare commodity: high-yield, disease-resistant bean varieties that can thrive on organic farms. “Most crops—about 95 percent—have been bred for conventional farming and can be difficult to grow in organic systems,” said Travis Parker, a Ph.D. student in plant biology who is leading the project. “These new bean varieties could make a big difference in performance and profitability of organic legumes like pinto, black and kidney beans, as well as heirloom-like varieties with high culinary quality.” Parker is working with a team of student breeders under the guidance of Professor Paul Gepts, a bean geneticist in the Department of Plant Sciences. The bean project is part of a larger plant-breeding effort at UC Davis to develop new varieties of tomatoes, peppers, beans and other vegetable crops that can flourish in both organic and conventional systems. 2 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 In January 2018, UC Davis relaunched the World Food Center under the interim direction of Kent Bradford, a distinguished professor in the Department of Plant Sciences and director of the Seed Biotechnology Center. Originally created in 2013 under the auspices of the Chancellor’s Office, the World Food Center is envisioned as a means to mobilize the research, educational and outreach resources of UC Davis to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems. In late 2017, the center was realigned under the direction of the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. One of the center’s primary goals is to translate promising new university research to the commercial sector on a wide range of subjects in food and agriculture. “We want to go out externally to let people know about the food-related expertise we have here at UC Davis,” said Bradford. “Even many of our faculty don’t realize the full extent of our resources.” In May and June 2018, the World Food Center highlighted diverse centers and institutes in two Food for Thought Showcases that were attended by 500 participants from UC Davis and the surrounding area.

                "data": "by Diane Nelson Nitrogen Efficiency Coming together to protect the planet and feed the world in Modesto for more than 40 years. He stays up-to-date on the latest science and invests in technology that keeps his farming sustainable. He uses precision technology to apply nitrogen, for example, that essentially spoon-feeds water and nutrients to his trees. “Our yields have increased quite a bit since we switched to precision application,” says Bowman, adjusting his hat against the noonday sun. “And that’s without adding any extra nitrogen. That’s huge.” Besides almonds, Bowman has something else developing in this fertile field—nitrogen efficiency research. A team of UC Davis experts has installed one tower, 20 wells and many yards of tubes on Bowman’s farm to measure the complete nitrogen cycle—what goes in and what goes out. The uniquely interactive project will shed light on perhaps the most pressing question in agriculture today: How do we nourish the crops that feed us without harming the environment in which we live? “It’s about balance,” says UC Davis plant physiology professor Patrick Brown, standing beside Bowman beneath a tree. “When we work together to understand the science and the constraints, we can design a system that maximizes nitrogen efficiency and minimizes impact on the environment.” ART BOWMAN HAS BEEN GROWING ALMONDS Why nitrogen matters All plants need nitrogen to grow. Nitrogen is vital to producing high-yield crops to feed billions of people worldwide. But excess nutrients can pollute air and drinking water and cause serious health and environmental risks. Every crop has different nutrient needs, and even those requirements vary based on factors such as soil type, weather, irrigation and how much nitrogen crops can access from organic matter in the soil. Crops suffer if they don’t get enough nitrogen, but too much is bad, too. Excess nutrients can leach into groundwater, which many Californians depend on for drinking water. It’s hard to track the timing and source of pollutants in groundwater. Pollutants can leach down from farms and dairies, and also from industrial uses, such as gas stations. It can take years and even decades to detect nitrogen in a drinking-water well, so it can be difficult to evaluate groundwater impacts from current farming practices. A changing landscape Nitrogen use has changed dramatically in California. Forty years ago, farmers generally applied a year’s worth of fertilizer at the start of the season. “We’d broadcast it out and hope for the rains to come,” Bowman remembers. The rains did come, and too often washed away excess nutrients or leached them below the root zone. As Brown says, “It’s like feeding your pigs all their food all at once and expecting any to still be there at the end of the year.” These days, most farmers apply smaller amounts of nitrogen throughout the season. UC Davis researchers have created online resources such as the California Fertilization Guidelines to help farmers determine the rate and timing of application to meet their plants’ needs. 4 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 ",

                "data": "Studying the whole puzzle Researchers have a good understanding of how much a crop needs and when it needs it. This five-year project will shed light on the bigger picture. “We’re looking at all the puzzle pieces, all at once,” Brown says. “We’re studying the entire nitrogen cycle above ground, at the root level and down deeper in the groundwater. We’re measuring nitrogen emissions, and we’re also surveying 6,500 farmers to better understand their needs and constraints. While a sound knowledge of the science of nitrogen is critical to future sustainability, it is equally important we understand how growers are implementing these advances and the challenges they face.” The UC Davis team includes faculty, postdoctoral and graduate student researchers in hydrology, plant physiology, environmental policy and other fields. Researchers are collaborating with the California Almond Board, government agencies, regional water boards, farmers, environmentalists and others. “We find solutions when we work together,” Brown says. Policymakers are designing laws to regulate how farmers manage nitrogen. This project seeks to build consensus and provide scientific basis for those regulations. The perfect plot This experiment couldn’t happen without farmers like Bowman, according to Thomas Harter, Cooperative Extension specialist with the UC Davis Department of Land, Air and Water Resources. Harter is leading the study’s groundwater component. “We needed 150 acres in San Joaquin Valley with a specific soil profile, a fairly shallow water table and no interferences from other sources of nitrogen, like dairies,” Harter says. “It’s not easy to find someone willing to open up their orchard and accommodate our equipment and researchers, let alone work together to improve management practices. Art is a tremendous collaborator.” Bowman is happy to help researchers get good data for such a critical cause. “Nitrogen efficiency matters to us all,” Bowman says. “I will pass this land on to my children—I care about the environment. I support farming practices that are good for the environment, and that are manageable and economically sustainable, too.” • Collaborators gather to study nitrogen efficiency in a Modesto almond orchard, including, from left, postdoctoral researcher Hanna Ouaknin; Professor Patrick Brown; Ph.D. student Jessica Rudnick; grower Art Bowman; Professor Gail Taylor; Ph.D. student Patrick Nichols; and Sebastian Saa Silver, UC Davis alum and agricultural researcher with the California Almond Board.

                "data": "Bull Market Collaboration with the beef industry tests advanced breeding technologies By Robin DeRieux As ruminants, they eat grass and other plants that are inedible to people, transforming forage into steak and hamburgers and other tasty high-protein beef products. Over the past few decades, the beef industry has made significant improvements in productivity— generating more food from fewer numbers of cattle. Better breeding and other innovations in animal science research have played a starring role in these advances. “More efficient cattle that produce higher yield per head reduce the overall COWS ARE SPECIAL. environmental footprint of a pound of beef,” said Alison Van Eenennaam, a UC Davis Cooperative Extension specialist in animal genomics and biotechnology. “That’s why beef production efficiency matters to the general public.” As an expert in livestock genetics, Van Eenennaam wanted to try out advanced breeding technologies on a larger scale than the 150 head of cattle managed by the Department of Animal Science would allow. She sought an industry collaboration to do a research project involving genetic evaluations on a commercial herd to identify important traits such as fertility, growth and disease resistance. Overcoming barriers There were obstacles. One was the structure of the beef industry itself. In vertically integrated beef operations, one company owns the cows, the calves, the feedlot and the processing facility. More frequently in the beef industry, however, the cow-calf sector sells to the feedlot, where cattle spend time fattening up for market before they are sold to the processing sector. There might be three or more different owners of an animal before your hamburger is served up next to your fries, and all these owners have different genetic selection objectives. Separations in the supply chain make data sharing difficult and complicate breeding decisions. There are three primary sectors: • Cow-calf sector, where owners are primarily interested in fertility, health and weaning weight • Feedlot sector, where owners are Justin Buchanan, a UC Davis postdoctoral researcher for Alison Van Eenennaam of the Department of Animal Science, was hired by Simplot as a geneticist at the project’s conclusion. 6 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 ",

In the United States, the cattle industry is the largest agricultural commodity in the nation, generating more than $100 billion in farm cash receipts. Within the cattle industry, Van Eenennaam sought to partner with a vertically integrated company that could make the large initial investment required to get a genomic research operation up and running. Enter Simplot. She pitched a collaborative project to the livestock division of Simplot, a privately owned company based in Idaho, and together they launched a three-year research study with 14,000 cattle in 2014. “This was a big, audacious, risky project at a time when genomic value had not been clearly demonstrated in the beef industry,” said Van Eenennaam. “It took a lot of trust and collaboration to get it done. But I think that’s exactly the role we should be playing, which is helping translate a new technology to industry.” Tech industry helps too From UC Davis, Van Eenennaam’s research team included master’s student Bryan Welly and postdoctoral fellow Justin Buchanan. Simplot’s participants included veterinarian Randall Raymond—director of research and veterinary services for Simplot Livestock—and a team of research technicians and data analysts, as well as feedlot and ranch staff. Also collaborating on the project was the biotechnology company GeneSeek, which provided genotyping services. “Our goal was to really understand the economic costs and benefits of using a genomic selection system in a commercial beef cattle operation,” said Raymond of Simplot. “What we learned was that we can increase the accuracy of genetic selection, and we can increase the rate of genetic gain. But the cost of developing that system from scratch is very high, and there’s a long time frame to pay back the infrastructure costs.” Although the three-year study at Simplot concluded in 2017, the UC Davis connection continues. The postdoctoral researcher who worked on the project with Van Eenennaam was subsequently hired as a geneticist by Simplot to continue the work. “A lot of good research comes out of academia, but there’s not always a chance to apply it in industry,” said Buchanan, who joined Simplot in 2017. “A collaboration like this gives Simplot the opportunity to transfer that knowledge over to industry and to use it in a meaningful way.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 7 ",

In collaboration with UC Davis Cooperative Extension, Roduner Ranch vineyard manager Guerrero is experimenting with Cabernet Sauvignon vines and other varieties elevated by a single wire at 66 inches—plantings that are 2-to-3 feet higher than the traditional wine grape canopy. The high-wire method causes grapes to grow downward and reduces the need for manual labor, allowing vineyard management practices such as pruning, leaf removal, berry thinning and other processes to be performed mechanically at just the right time for a fraction of the cost. KARIN HIGGINS/UC Davis Kaan Kurtural (right), a UC Davis Cooperative Extension viticulture specialist, talks with Roduner Ranch manager Miguel Guerrero of The Wine Group about a vineyard trial with grapes growing on a high wire. 8 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 “The beauty of the high-wire system is that the fruit zone is really defined—a solid wall of grape clusters—and the pruning machine can just zip right alongside the vines,” said Kaan Kurtural, a UC Davis Cooperative Extension viticulture specialist. “We can carry more crop, and with mechanical leaf removal, we get that sun-dappled exposure that feeds the fruit. Less leaf cover means the vines require less water, and the grape quality is much better.” SURPRISING THE SKEPTICS Kurtural has established a small demonstration vineyard planted on high wires at Oakville Station in Napa that is completely mechanized. In the tradition-steeped wine industry, some worry that mechanizing labor practices in vineyards will lower the quality of the wine. One industry partner, The Wine Group headquartered in Livermore, has participated with UC Cooperative Extension on field trials showing that mechanical practices can actually enhance quality. The Wine Group is an industry giant that farms the 3,000-acre Roduner Ranch and many other properties in the San Joaquin Valley and along the Central Coast. The company owns a variety of brands that include Concannon Vineyard, Cupcake Vineyards and Almaden Vineyards. While Napa and Sonoma valleys are better known for wine production, vineyards in the San Joaquin Valley produce 70 percent of the volume of the wine grape crush in the United States. Grapes from District 13 (the area surrounding Fresno 100 miles out) typically sell for about $300 per ton, while Napa Valley grapes average more than $5,000 per ton.

With our new canopy management practices, our winemakers are noticing a difference in the quality of our reds.” KEEPING WINE IN CALIFORNIA Today, the $35 billion dollar California wine industry accounts for 90 percent of the nation’s wine production and is the fourth largest wine producer in the world. Back in the 1930s, however, viticulture in California was in shambles after more than a decade of Prohibition. University of California scientists provided research-based knowledge that helped rebuild the industry, which still includes many small, family-owned businesses that have passed along through generations. At UC Davis, Kurtural and other researchers continue to collaborate with winegrowers and winemakers on labor and other critical issues. “In order to keep our industry thriving for future generations, we want to make sure that the knowledge and technology we’re developing get into the field or the winery as quickly as possible,” said Professor David Block, chair of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology. “I think the best solutions to industry challenges—labor, water, soil, yields, quality— are going to come from collaborations between farmers, the university and tech companies.” The V&E department’s ongoing partnerships with J. Lohr Vineyards and Wines, the Robert Mondavi Winery, E.& J. Gallo Winery, Tule Technologies, Cypress Semiconductor and many others have advanced wine science both in the vineyard and in the winery. Out among the vast vineyards of the San Joaquin Valley, UC Davis Cooperative Extension farm advisor George Zhuang, viticulture specialist Kurtural, as well as researchers from Fresno State University, continue studies to get the very best from hot-weather wine grapes. “Our partnership originally started with one trial project on our 2,500-acre ranch in Fresno,” said Nick Davis, a vineyard operations manager for The Wine Group. “Now we have four.

But according to striking results from a long-term experiment in a walnut orchard in Red Bluff, California, growers can improve crop production if they hold off irrigation until later in the season and directly measure their trees’ water needs. “It’s a game changer,” says walnut grower Hal Crain, who welcomed researchers onto his OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 orchard to test irrigation optimization. “It’s clear to me you can improve nut quality and yield by applying water based on what the tree wants and needs, rather than just watering when it’s hot outside and the soil is dry. That’s a big deal for walnut growers and for the entire agricultural industry.” Changing the paradigm Crain is a second-generation farmer whose family has been growing walnuts in Butte and ",

Like most walnut farmers, Crain had always started irrigating in early-to-mid May when the days grew warmer and the trees sprouted leaves. “That’s standard practice for probably 90 percent of California’s walnut growers,” Crain says, walking amid his trees on a sunny afternoon. “The theory is that when you irrigate early, you preserve the deep moisture in the soil that trees need to survive the heat of summer.” But that’s not how it works, the study shows. Instead, trees that grow in saturated soil early in the season don’t develop the deep roots they need to thrive. “With all the water right there at the surface, the lower roots suffer,” explains Bruce Lampinen, Cooperative Extension orchard management specialist with the UC Davis air-pressure devices that measure a leaf or small shoot to gauge how hard the plant is working to pull moisture from the soil. “Just because the soil looks dry doesn’t mean the plant is suffering,” says Professor Shackel, who specializes in plant physiology. “Pressure chambers let you ask the tree how it’s feeling— sort of like taking a human’s blood pressure— which is a much more accurate way to measure a plant’s water needs.” For the last five years, the team has been applying different water treatments to five blocks of trees. One block is getting standard, early irrigation. Crain’s orchard managers begin irrigating the other blocks when the trees reach different levels of water stress based on pressure-chamber readings. The trees that experience moderate stress are So, when is the best time to start irrigating? Department of Plant Sciences. “Trees end up with a very shallow root system, which doesn’t serve them well as they try to extract moisture from the soil later on.” Lampinen has long suspected that walnuts were getting too much water in the spring. “A lot of the symptoms we see like yellowing leaves and various diseases can all be explained by overwatering,” Lampinen says. So Lampinen did what scientists do: He set up an experiment. Five years ago, with funding from the California Walnut Board and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he joined forces with plant sciences professor Ken Shackel and UC Cooperative Extension irrigation advisor Allan Fulton. Together, they led a team of scientists testing irrigation on Crain’s ranch. “Hal is an exceptional partner,” says UC farm advisor Allan Fulton. “Farmers have a lot to accommodate when they host an experiment like this, with researchers going in and out of the orchard at all hours. He had to work around our people and the timing of our water treatments. He’s always eager to experiment with technology and learn new things, and he shares what he learns with other growers. Hal completes the circle.” So, when is the best time to start irrigating? To answer that question, researchers ask the trees. They use pressure chambers, which are doing the best. Their irrigation usually starts in mid-to-late June, several weeks later than when standard watering begins. “You can tell just by looking at that block that the trees are healthier,” Crain says, standing beneath a canopy of lush, green trees. “And, we’re seeing greater yields and better nut quality.” Translating the research The study is helping researchers and Crain advise farmers on irrigation. “My biggest takeaway is that when you start watering is a really important factor to the health of your trees,” Lampinen says. Pressure chambers—sometimes called pressure bombs—can cost more than $3,000, and high-tech versions are in development. “I tell growers a pressure bomb would pay for itself even if you just used it once a year to determine when to start watering,” Lampinen says. Crain is certainly convinced. “When you irrigate based on your trees’ needs, you optimize water,” Crain says. “I’m not using less water overall, but the water I do use is producing more food. That’s good news for everyone.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 13 ",

In graduate school he analyzed the interplay between water and energy use in 160 countries, studied melting glaciers in Peru and helped design a clean energy system for the Azores—all to help policymakers develop more efficient systems. “If we understand how these systems are connected, we can identify opportunities to implement water conservation programs that also save energy and vice versa,” he said. UC Davis recruited Spang in 2011 to help launch the Center for Water-Energy Efficiency. Center researchers created a method to measure precisely how much energy is used to deliver water. In 2015, Spang joined the Department of Food Science and Technology, splitting his time between the center and the department. “Now I’m looking at how a more efficient food system saves both water and energy upstream and materials such as land, nutrients and other agricultural inputs,” he said. “I also naturally gravitated to the topic of food loss and waste, which happens across the entire food supply chain from the farm to the consumer’s plate.” With campus colleagues, Spang formed the Food Loss and Waste Collaborative to provide a focal point for networking and information. More than 50 faculty and students from 10 different departments and centers are now involved, and it’s those partnerships, especially with the students, that have really impressed him. “I’ve been astounded by their commitment, their abilities and their attitudes toward research,” he said. His students nominated Spang for a Walker Academic Advising Award, an honor he received in May. “I love this work and I really like being at UC Davis,” he said. “I feel like I have all the resources I need to pursue interesting research, and I am consistently inspired by the ideas and enthusiasm brought forward by the students here on campus.” —John Stumbos FOOD SCIENCE PROFESSOR NED SPANG UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 17 ",

It will be known as the “Joseph and Margie Ogawa Field Laboratory.” Department faculty envision a flexible facility with a drying oven, clean air hood and other laboratory tools that can be reconfigured to handle the many different types of crops grown at the 130-acre site known as the Armstrong Tract. “All of this is going to make it really easy to set up experiments without having the difficulty of transport,” Rizzo said. “It’s going to make a huge difference.” “Joe” Ogawa grew up on a farm near Sanger. During World War II, he and his family were incarcerated in a government camp in the Arizona desert. He was accepted to the University of Nebraska and studied dairy for a semester until being drafted by the U.S. Army in January 1945. Ogawa resumed his education at UC Davis, earning a B.S. in pomology (1950) and a Ph.D. in plant pathology (1954). He specialized in diseases of tree fruit, nut crops and fresh market tomatoes. He was described by colleagues as a brilliant researcher and devoted teacher who, according to one almond grower, “spoke the farmer’s language.” Honoring parents \t Ogawa daughters’ gift gives plant pathology new capabilities at field headquarters site at the Department of Plant Pathology’s field headquarters south of campus is undergoing a major transformation into a new laboratory thanks to the generosity of Julie Ogawa and Jo Ann Ogawa Kruger, daughters of renowned UC Davis Professor Joseph Ogawa. When Joseph Ogawa died in 1996, his family and the agriculture industry he served so well stepped up and created a fund that supports the research of plant pathology students. Three years ago, Margie Ogawa passed away, and her daughters wanted to find an additional way to honor both parents. “We always wanted to do something for the university,” Julie Ogawa said. “The university was their whole life.” Last year the sisters visited Hutchison Hall, where their dad worked for many of his 37 years as faculty. They considered renovating a classroom, but department chair Dave Rizzo had another idea. He explained the difficulty in transporting samples and equipment from field headquarters to campus. An on-site laboratory could dramatically improve teaching and research capabilities. They loved the idea. “That was something specifically for plant pathology, and it was where dad spent a lot of AN OLD BUILDING 18 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 —John Stumbos Julie Ogawa (left) and her sister Jo Ann Ogawa Kruger contributed funds for an on-site plant pathology lab in their parents’ name.

During an internship her sophomore year she had a career awakening that put her onto a different path. Karen volunteered at the Easter Seal Society. “It was good hands-on experience,” she said. “But I came to realize that what really appealed to me more than the physical therapy itself was the psychological and emotional aspect of working with patients.” She quickly found her way taking human development courses that included participating at the university’s preschool program. Her new goal was to become an early childhood educator. Karen wrote her own major in the Department of Applied Behavioral Sciences (now the Department of Human Ecology). “That major seemed perfect for me,” she said. “I could combine sociology and psychology courses with human development courses and focus on child psychology. My plan was approved!” Karen recognizes just how valuable those experiences were. “As the saying goes, ‘Experience is often the best teacher.’ I believe it takes both academic training and experience. Experience adds critical elements to career preparation and can help people find their niche.” She wants today’s students to have similar opportunities, so she recently created the Karen Cauble Heritage Fund for Experiential Learning. The fund will assist human ecology students in complementing their classroom learning with internships, field courses, site visits and other off-campus activities in behavioral science. She inserted the word “heritage” in the fund name to honor her supportive parents, George and Christine Shacklady, and her uncle, Robert Carlson, a UC Davis pomology professor who was very influential in her motivation to attend college. UC Davis was good for Karen in other areas of her life, too. “The human development and psychology courses helped me develop effective communication skills I use on a daily basis with people of all ages.” A professor once asked her, “What’s the worst that can happen?” She’s lived by that adage ever since. Her time at the university and other life experiences taught Karen to look at things from different perspectives and, as she put it, “trust your instincts.” Karen encourages fellow alumni to think about how their UC Davis education has affected not only their careers but also their personal lives and to find ways to give back. “Be creative. You can provide general support through the annual fund or you can do what I did and send your welcome donation into something more specific that speaks to you.” —John Stumbos Karen Cauble encourages fellow alumni to find ways to give back to the university.

In his sophomore year, Farley joined the Alpha Gamma Rho (AGR) fraternity and the doors of opportunity opened. Through AGR he established lifelong friendships and met his future bride, Kathy Devery. “That’s when I really began to see agriculture as a career path,” Farley said. “Alpha Gamma Rho was the catalyst that showed me farming opera- tions, something I hadn’t experienced before.” He visited the farms of fellow fraternity brothers and learned about agriculture from the inside. Two of his current business partners, Fred Williamson and John King, are fraternity brothers and UC Davis graduates. UC Davis extension specialist Bob Kasmire helped Farley gain more inside knowledge of the produce business by encouraging him to take a short course in the postharvest technology of horticultural crops so he could meet working professionals and learn about real-world industry practices. 20 OUTLOOK FALL/WINTER 2018 KATIE FARLEY ERNIE FARLEY (’87, Ernie Farley has been instrumental in showing UC Davis students the world of opportunity that exists in California’s produce industry. He described his major as a versatile tool that grounded him in both the business and science of agriculture. “I developed a library of terms and an understanding that enabled me to become an effective team member after I graduated,” he said. Farley has been active in a number of industry leadership posts, including the Grower- Shipper Association and the Produce Marketing Association. He also is part of the forward- thinking Equitable Food Initiative, a stakeholder group developing solutions for social justice and environmental issues. Through this effort, thousands of farm workers have been trained in communication skills, conflict management, rights and responsibilities and food safety. In recent years, Farley became instrumental in organizing tours of coastal produce operations for UC Davis students. He also became a member of the CA&ES Dean’s Advisory Council, a new experience he relishes. “There are so many challenges facing the production of food for the world,” he said. “It’s absolutely inspiring to listen to so many smart people and learn what they’re doing to come up with solutions.” —John Stumbos ",
