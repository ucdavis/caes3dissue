Soil: The Secret Ingredient
<br>
In agriculture, it’s easy to focus on what we see aboveground, like crop yield and food quality. But below the
<br>
surface, healthy soil is a key ingredient to making food production possible. Healthy soil retains more nutrients,
<br>
protects plants from disease, improves water management, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and so much more.
<br>
<br>
Students get the dirt on healthy soil in a trench behind the Bowley Plant Sciences Center as Assistant Professor
<br>
Amélie Gaudin (top left, pointing) shows them how soil that’s alive with microbes can keep farming productive,
<br>
profitable and resilient.
