12 WHEN IT COMES TO WATERING WALNUTS ,
<br>
most California growers believe you need to start
<br>
early to keep trees healthy and productive
<br>
throughout the long, hot summer. But according
<br>
to striking results from a long-term experiment
<br>
in a walnut orchard in Red Bluff, California,
<br>
growers can improve crop production if they
<br>
hold off irrigation until later in the season and
<br>
directly measure their trees’ water needs.
<br>
<br>
“It’s a game changer,” says walnut grower
<br>
Hal Crain, who welcomed researchers onto his
<br>

<br>
orchard to test irrigation optimization. “It’s clear
<br>
to me you can improve nut quality and yield by
<br>
applying water based on what the tree wants and
<br>
needs, rather than just watering when it’s hot
<br>
outside and the soil is dry. That’s a big deal for
<br>
walnut growers and for the entire agricultural
<br>
industry.” Changing the paradigm
