UC Davis and the wine industry cultivate a fruitful relationship
<br>

<br>
SOUTH OF MERCED ,
<br>
under the hot summer sun
<br>
of the San Joaquin Valley, Miguel Guerrero of
<br>
The Wine Group is trying a new high-wire act.
<br>
<br>
In collaboration with UC Davis Cooperative
<br>
Extension, Roduner Ranch vineyard manager
<br>
Guerrero is experimenting with Cabernet
<br>
Sauvignon vines and other varieties elevated
<br>
by a single wire at 66 inches—plantings that
<br>
are 2-to-3 feet higher than the traditional wine
<br>
grape canopy.
<br>
<br>
The high-wire method causes grapes to
<br>
grow downward and reduces the need for
<br>
manual labor, allowing vineyard management
<br>
practices such as pruning, leaf removal, berry
<br>
thinning and other processes to be performed
<br>
mechanically at just the right time for a fraction
<br>
of the cost.

<br>
“The beauty of the high-wire system is that
<br>
the fruit zone is really defined—a solid wall of
<br>
grape clusters—and the pruning machine can
<br>
just zip right alongside the vines,” said Kaan
<br>
Kurtural, a UC Davis Cooperative Extension
<br>
viticulture specialist. “We can carry more crop,
<br>
and with mechanical leaf removal, we get that
<br>
sun-dappled exposure that feeds the fruit. Less
<br>
leaf cover means the vines require less water,
<br>
and the grape quality is much better.”
<br>
SURPRISING THE SKEPTICS
<br>
Kurtural has established a small
<br>
demonstration vineyard planted on high wires
<br>
at Oakville Station in Napa that is completely
<br>
mechanized. In the tradition-steeped wine
<br>
industry, some worry that mechanizing labor
<br>
practices in vineyards will lower the quality
<br>
of the wine. One industry partner, The Wine
<br>
Group headquartered in Livermore, has
<br>
participated with UC Cooperative Extension on
<br>
field trials showing that mechanical practices
<br>
can actually enhance quality.
<br>
<br>
The Wine Group is an industry giant that
<br>
farms the 3,000-acre Roduner Ranch and many
<br>
other properties in the San Joaquin Valley and
<br>
along the Central Coast. The company owns
<br>
a variety of brands that include Concannon
<br>
Vineyard, Cupcake Vineyards and Almaden
<br>
Vineyards. While Napa and Sonoma valleys are better
<br>
known for wine production, vineyards in the
<br>
San Joaquin Valley produce 70 percent of the
<br>
volume of the wine grape crush in the United
<br>
States. Grapes from District 13 (the area
<br>
surrounding Fresno 100 miles out) typically
<br>
sell for about $300 per ton, while Napa Valley
<br>
grapes average more than $5,000 per ton. With
<br>
a thinner profit margin, San Joaquin Valley
<br>

vintners have a greater incentive to try out
<br>
mechanized vineyard practices.
<br>
<br>
“Before, growing grapes in the San Joaquin
<br>
Valley was all about production and big yields,”
<br>
said Roduner Ranch manager Guerrero,
<br>
gesturing toward row after row of vines from
<br>
the cab of his pickup truck. “But we started
<br>
attending UC Davis Cooperative Extension
<br>
meetings, and we started learning a little more
<br>
about what to do to improve ripening and bring
<br>
out the best in the grapes. With our new canopy
<br>
management practices, our winemakers are
<br>
noticing a difference in the quality of our reds.”
<br>
KEEPING WINE IN CALIFORNIA
<br>
Today, the $35 billion dollar California
<br>
wine industry accounts for 90 percent of the
<br>
nation’s wine production and is the fourth
<br>
largest wine producer in the world. Back in
<br>
the 1930s, however, viticulture in California
<br>
was in shambles after more than a decade of
<br>
Prohibition. University of California scientists
<br>
provided research-based knowledge that helped
<br>
rebuild the industry, which still includes many
<br>
small, family-owned businesses that have passed
<br>
along through generations.
<br>
<br>
At UC Davis, Kurtural and other researchers
<br>
continue to collaborate with winegrowers and
<br>
winemakers on labor and other critical issues.
<br>
<br>
“In order to keep our industry thriving for
<br>
future generations, we want to make sure that
<br>
the knowledge and technology we’re developing
<br>
get into the field or the winery as quickly as
<br>
possible,” said Professor David Block, chair of
<br>
the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and
<br>
Enology. “I think the best solutions to industry
<br>
challenges—labor, water, soil, yields, quality—
<br>
are going to come from collaborations between
<br>
farmers, the university and tech companies.”
<br>
The V&E department’s ongoing partnerships
<br>
with J. Lohr Vineyards and Wines, the Robert
<br>
Mondavi Winery, E.& J. Gallo Winery, Tule
<br>
Technologies, Cypress Semiconductor and many
<br>
others have advanced wine science both in the
<br>
vineyard and in the winery.
<br>
<br>
Out among the vast vineyards of the San
<br>
Joaquin Valley, UC Davis Cooperative Extension
<br>
farm advisor George Zhuang, viticulture
<br>
specialist Kurtural, as well as researchers from
<br>
Fresno State University, continue studies to get
<br>
the very best from hot-weather wine grapes.
<br>
<br>
“Our partnership originally started with one
<br>
trial project on our 2,500-acre ranch in Fresno,”
<br>
said Nick Davis, a vineyard operations manager
<br>
for The Wine Group. “Now we have four. I
<br>
think that shows how well The Wine Group and
<br>
Cooperative Extension work together.”
