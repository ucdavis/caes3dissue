Writers Our college relies on input from farmers, ranchers
<br>
and other agricultural leaders to solve critical
<br>
issues in food production. Partners help identify
<br>
concerns to address, and they provide working
<br>
landscapes where researchers can conduct
<br>
tests. Together with our partners, the College
<br>
of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences
<br>
will continue to foster the sustainability and
<br>
vitality of agriculture.

ON THE COVER
<br>
Students from Professor Sam
<br>
Sandoval’s water science and
<br>
management class visit the farm
<br>
of Glenn McGourty on the banks
<br>
of the Russian River. McGourty, a
<br>
county advisor for UC Cooperative
<br>
Extension who specializes in
<br>
viticulture, showed students how
<br>
he manages water on his farm
<br>
after they had spent the day
<br>
learning about the local water
<br>
cycle. In his role as a county
<br>
advisor, McGourty also partners
<br>
with Mendocino County growers
<br>
to share the latest information on
<br>
sustainable water management
<br>
and other research developments
<br>
from UC Davis.
