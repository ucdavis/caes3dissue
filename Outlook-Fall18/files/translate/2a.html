Cattle and range industry
<br>
leaders recently met
<br>
with Dean Helene Dillard
<br>
and UC Davis faculty to
<br>
prioritize challenges and
<br>
opportunities that could
<br>
be addressed through
<br>
the Russell L. Rustici
<br>
Rangeland and Cattle
<br>
Research Endowment.
<br>
<br>
From the Dean
<br>
Partnerships support agricultural discoveries and productivity
<br>
UC DAVIS HAS A RICH HISTORY of
<br>
collaborative agricultural research. The University of
<br>
California created our campus more than a
<br>
century ago as a model farm to improve
<br>
agricultural science, instruction and production.
<br>
<br>
Working together with our partners, our college
<br>
has made agricultural discoveries that have
<br>
fundamentally changed the way we grow,
<br>
harvest, process, store and enjoy our food.
<br>
<br>
We can’t do it alone. Our college faculty
<br>
and student researchers work side by side with
<br>
farmers, industry representatives, government
<br>
agencies and others to develop innovations and
<br>
management strategies to increase agricultural
<br>
production while protecting our environment
<br>
and supporting healthy communities.
<br>
<br>
Scientists need input and support from the
<br>
agricultural industry from start to finish: to
<br>
know what issues to address, to find working
<br>
landscapes to conduct their experiments and
<br>
to help circulate findings back to the field.
<br>
<br>
Although farmers face inconvenience and
<br>
possible loss of production when they open up
<br>
their land to researchers, they do it to benefit
<br>
consumers and the entire industry.
<br>
<br>
Take, for example, a recent experiment with
<br>
walnuts and irrigation management. Growers
<br>
were concerned that their trees were exhibiting
<br>
unusual symptoms like yellowing leaves and
<br>
increased disease susceptibility. Researchers
<br>
suspected the walnut trees were receiving too
<br>
much water early in the season. To test their
<br>
theory, they needed access to an orchard for at
<br>
least five years. A walnut grower in Red Bluff
<br>
volunteered his land and managed his own
<br>
irrigation and treatment around the needs and
<br>
timing of university researchers. The study’s
<br>
results—which you can read about on page 12—
<br>
could greatly improve walnut yield and quality,
<br>
and now the Red Bluff grower is sharing that
<br>
valuable information with fellow farmers.
<br>
<br>
Similar stories abound in fields, orchards,
<br>
farms and vineyards throughout the state.
<br>
<br>
Our faculty, staff and students are partnering
<br>
with farmers and others to enhance nitrogen
<br>
efficiency, breed better cattle, build healthy soil,
<br>
mechanize wine grape cultivation, welcome
<br>
a new generation of ranchers, adopt energy-
<br>
efficient food systems and so much more.
<br>
<br>
Farmers in our state produce about half of
<br>
the produce and nuts grown in the U.S. and
<br>
nearly a quarter of the nation’s milk and cream.
<br>
<br>
California is the only major U.S. supplier of
<br>
tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, almonds, walnuts,
<br>
pistachios, grapes, olives, figs and many other
<br>
crops. Agricultural production and discoveries
<br>
in California can impact the entire world.
<br>
<br>
As agriculture faces many challenges, we
<br>
rigorously collaborate to find ways to feed a
<br>
growing population in the face of variable
<br>
weather, dwindling natural resources and a
<br>
shrinking labor supply. Together with our
<br>
many partners, I am confident we can develop
<br>
solutions to keep agriculture productive,
<br>
profitable and sustainable now and into
<br>
the future.

Writers Our college relies on input from farmers, ranchers

and other agricultural leaders to solve critical

issues in food production. Partners help identify

concerns to address, and they provide working

landscapes where researchers can conduct

tests. Together with our partners, the College

ON THE COVER
<br>
Students from Professor Sam
<br>
Sandoval’s water science and
<br>
management class visit the farm
<br>
of Glenn McGourty on the banks
<br>
of the Russian River. McGourty, a
<br>
county advisor for UC Cooperative
<br>
Extension who specializes in
<br>
viticulture, showed students how
<br>
he manages water on his farm
<br>
after they had spent the day
<br>
learning about the local water
<br>
cycle. In his role as a county
<br>
advisor, McGourty also partners
<br>
with Mendocino County growers
<br>
to share the latest information on
<br>
sustainable water management
<br>
and other research developments
<br>
from UC Davis.
