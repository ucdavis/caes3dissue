<br>
Scientists at

UC Davis who
<br>
are supported by
<br>
Agricultural Experiment
<br>
Station funding do
<br>
research and outreach
<br>
that affect the people
<br>
of California and the
<br>
world beyond. Visit
<br>
aes.ucdavis.edu The tradition of field days
<br>
is an effective method of
<br>
showing the agricultural
<br>
community the latest
<br>
innovations in plant and
<br>
animal production.
<br>
<br>
FIELD DAYS
<br>
When it comes to agricultural research,
<br>
there’s nothing like seeing it in action to learn
<br>
how it fits on your farm.
<br>
<br>
That’s why farmers, ranchers, crop advisers
<br>
and many others gather with UC researchers
<br>
at various times throughout the year to attend
<br>
field days sponsored by the college that focus
<br>
on specific agricultural topics. UC Davis
<br>
faculty, Cooperative Extension specialists
<br>
and county-based CE advisors partner with
<br>
attendees to learn about new varieties, pest
<br>
management strategies, nutrient requirements,
<br>
water management and other relevant updates.
<br>
<br>
Alfalfa and Small Grains Field Day meets
<br>
on campus in the spring. Rice Field Day meets
<br>
north of Yuba City in the summer. Other topics
<br>
covered throughout the year include walnuts,
<br>
weeds, strawberry breeding, healthy soil, beef,
<br>
and more.
