		<paragraph><![CDATA[climate change would alter the rhythms of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nature, but just how and when hasn’t been easy to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[predict. That’s why research, especially long-term ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[research, is so important. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[At a remote field site in Greenland, Professor ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Eric Post has studied changes in plant and animal ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[communities for more than a quarter century. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The UC Davis wildlife ecologist and his graduate ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[BRINGING THE SCIENCE BACK HOME ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Not only is Post’s work shedding light on ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[ecological shifts in the Arctic, but he and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[colleagues engage young students and their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[teachers back home to learn about field research ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[taking place at the top of the world. A project ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[called APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[through Engaged Science) shows K-12 teachers, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[through summer workshops in the U.S., how to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[deliver lessons about Greenland and climate change. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Over the course of five days, we give them ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[a crash course in climate change, how to teach ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[climate change, how to confront climate change ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[denial, and how we study the effects of climate ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[change in the Arctic,” Post said. “We also give ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[them the materials and methods to replicate what ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[we’re doing back in their own school yards.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[More than 30 teachers from 19 states are ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[involved in the program, which continues to grow. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Students are able to collect data on the timing ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of plant growth and share it through the APPLES ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[website. They also have access to the Greenland ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[data Post and his students are collecting and can ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[compare that to their own data. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[One of the more interesting research tools ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[students get to experiment with is a time-lapse ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[camera, just like the 50 such cameras Post and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[crew have spread out over 25 square miles of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[caribou calving range. Within the span of a few ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[minutes, students can watch the seasons unfold through a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[time-lapse movie from Greenland, with snow rapidly falling ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and melting and then plants growing and flowering. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[A CARIBOU HERD IN DECLINE ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Perhaps the most dramatic trend the scientists have noticed ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[is how few caribou remain at the study site. From a maximum ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of about 500 to 600 early on, numbers have dropped in the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[last three years to less than 100 caribou. The reason for the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[decline is unclear, but may in part relate to earlier plant ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[growth caused by a warmer climate. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Caribou are migratory animals. In Greenland, they remain ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[on the coast until springtime, when the change in day length ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[tells them it’s time to move eastward to their summer range ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and give birth to their calves. But the “caribou cafeteria” they’re ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[heading to is opening and closing earlier in the year, which is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[not good news if they arrive late for the buffet. The difference in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nutritional content of newly growing plants compared to older ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[plants is taking a toll on reproductive success. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Caribou produce fewer calves and those calves die at a ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[higher rate in earlier green-up years because caribou can’t ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[time their arrival to coincide ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[with the green flush in resources ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that they need to provision their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[calves,” Post said. “Yet we can’t say ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the decline is solely because of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[climate change, because there ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[are many complex factors ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[affecting this population.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Musk oxen, on the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[other hand, seem to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[be faring better. They ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[are already on site and don’t need to migrate to catch the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[springtime pulse of new plant growth. When the cafeteria ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[opens earlier, that’s a huge benefit for them. One of Post’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[graduate students has documented a correlation between ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[advancing spring growth and musk oxen abundance in her ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[master’s thesis. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[RAMPING UP POLAR STUDIES ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Post came to UC Davis in 2016 from Penn State, where he ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[was a professor focused on polar science for 16 years. But he ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[has long been drawn to UC Davis. “As far as I’m concerned, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[this is the best place for environmental research or ecology,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[he said. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Last year, Post launched the Polar Forum to engage the ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[has been lining up fascinating speakers like Felicity Aston, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the first woman to cross Antarctica alone, and Sergey Zimov, a ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[He has other projects in the works to grow this ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[exchange of ideas. He would also like to see UC Davis ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[offer a general polar studies course—and ultimately an ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[expanded curriculum. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Research will always be important,” Post said. ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[about 100 teenagers in Porto Alegre, Brazil, analyzing the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[teen’s brain activity in response to both threatening and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[positive stimuli. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“In previous experiments in the U.S., we found that ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[pleasure are more at risk for depression,” Swartz said. “These ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We know that many things like diet, exercise, stress and ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[foreign countries—mostly Mexico—to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[work in the fields. Only two percent of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[California’s farmworkers were born in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the U.S. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[But Mexico is changing. Fertility rates ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[and fewer young people have the need ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[or interest to come to America to pick ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[crops. California’s farm-labor supply ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from Mexico has been decreasing for ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[several years. New data from a long-term ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[study by UC Davis researchers suggests ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[that supply will soon disappear. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“The flow of abundant labor ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from Mexico is coming to an end,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[said Professor J. Edward Taylor, an ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[agricultural economist and co-author ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[It will be politically and logistically ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[hard for farmers to find plentiful, low- ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[wage labor from other regions. Most ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[developing countries are either too ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[small, too far away or urbanizing too ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[quickly. Also, Mexico’s agriculture ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[industry is growing rapidly, attracting ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[workers from Guatemala and other ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[countries who might otherwise be ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[driven to harvest crops in America. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[The changes create challenges for ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[U.S. agriculture. UC Davis researchers ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[are developing mechanized harvesters, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[robotic weeders and other technologies ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to help farmers produce more food with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[fewer workers. The new machines and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[management practices require skilled ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[labor, which Taylor says could ultimately ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[benefit farming and farmworkers. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“The demand for more skilled ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[workers means rising productivity and ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Reverse migration ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[By the mid-20th century, most ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Americans no longer worked in the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[fields. U.S. growers turned to Mexico to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[bolster their supply of farm labor. Some ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[farmworkers arrived on temporary work ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[visas and others crossed the border ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[through authorized and unauthorized ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[immigration. For decades, this flow of low-wage ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[labor helped U.S. growers increase ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[production of fruits, vegetables and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[other crops. But the pace of immigration ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[has slowed dramatically. Between 2007 ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and 2015, the number of unauthorized ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[immigrants living in the U.S. declined ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[19 percent—from 6.9 million to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[5.6 million. Researchers say more ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[unauthorized immigrants are returning ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to Mexico than entering America. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Taylor and his team conducted ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[surveys with a nationally representative ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[sample of 2,000 rural Mexican families, ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[nonagricultural pay has narrowed and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[farmers’ use of guest-worker programs ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[has doubled. Some farmers would like ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[an expanded guest-worker program, but ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Taylor predicts that would provide only ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[temporary relief. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Immigration policy can’t solve the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[problem if workers don’t want to work in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[agriculture,” he said. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Mechanization and management ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[efficiency may be the key. “Farmers will ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[have to produce more with less,” Taylor ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[said. “That’s the bottom line.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Some growers have already switched ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[from labor-intensive crops like peaches ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[to crops that are harvested by machines, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[such as almonds. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[UC Davis researchers are developing ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[tractors that can distinguish a weed from ]]></paragraph>
