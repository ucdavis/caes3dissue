Kebreab was recently named associate dean of Global Engagement and director of the World Food Center. GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis From the Dean Department of Animal Science Professor Ermias Kebreab was appointed associate dean of Global Engagement and director of the World Food Center earlier this year. This new position replaces the CA&ES associate dean for International Programs, a position held previously by emeritus faculty Jan Hopmans and Jim Hill. A distinguished scholar and skilled administrator, Kebreab has held several key positions at UC Davis, including associate vice provost of academic programs for Global Affairs and deputy director for the Agricultural Sustainability Institute. He is the Sesnon Endowed Chair in the Department of Animal Science and conducts research on using feed additives to reduce methane emissions from livestock. Kebreab also has done significant work with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the National Academy of Sciences and the USDA National Animal Nutrition Program. He is a founding member of Dairy 2050, a think tank in scientific leadership working toward sustainability of the U.S. dairy industry in the global market. With Kebreab’s significant experience and vision for engagement, we are poised to broaden the horizons of our international programs. In this issue of our college magazine, we highlight a few examples of our global engagement. is to promote agricultural, environmental and social sustainability through our research, teaching and public engagement to meet the challenges of global change—and that’s a key distinction. The challenges we face are not just confined to California or to the United States. They are increasingly of a global nature, brought about by the needs of a growing world population. That’s why we support students going abroad to explore and study in other countries, why we invest in capacity-building training and research in emerging economies, and why we engage in collaborative programs with academic institutions throughout the world. For many years, the college’s International Programs Office (IPO) has been a focal point for much of the work in agriculture, food, nutrition and health in Africa, Asia and the Americas. IPO has been extraordinarily effective at tapping expertise within the college to build bridges with parts of the world that need help. Another program more recently under the guidance of the college is the World Food Center, charged with bringing together partners in academia, industry and the civic sector to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems. With leadership changes at both the IPO and the World Food Center, we found an opportunity to revisit our strategy for promoting research and outreach abroad and were fortunate to recruit a marvelously talented individual within the college to take over leadership.

The new building will include a milking parlor, milk room, clean room, aged cheese room and packing room—everything needed to produce and sell Grade A goat cheese while providing exceptional opportunities for hands-on learning. About 100 students annually take courses at the goat facility, which hosts a herd of anywhere from 65 to 125 goats. The new building should be open for business later this year. We mourn the loss of Dean Emeritus Charley Hess—a “kind and great man” GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis Meat Lab students found the right cure— with beef jerky—to regain the team title in the college section of the California Association of Meat Processors’ Cured Meat Competition. With the recent win, UC Davis has now had possession of the Norm Eggin Championship Cup for six out of the seven years it has been awarded. In each year’s contest, competitors are assigned the same cured meat to prepare. This year it was whole-muscle jerky from beef. “Our students worked long hours researching, trying out and tweaking the recipes and slicing techniques until they had products worthy of entering,” said Caleb Sehnert, Meat Lab manager and team coach. “I couldn’t be happier for them—or prouder.” Charles E. “Charley” Hess, a UC Davis Medal recipient and dean emeritus of the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, passed away on April 13 of congestive heart failure at the age of 87. Hess died on Picnic Day, the biggest celebration of the year at the institution he so loved. Hess was college dean from 1975 to 1989 and led the development of the Integrated Pest Management Program, the Student Farm and Education Program and the UC Davis Biotechnology Program. He was the campus’ first director of International Programs and he served as vice chair of the National Science Board, as well as USDA assistant secretary of science and education. Even after Hess’ “retirement” from UC Davis in 1994, he accepted temporary appointments as chair of the Department of Nutrition and vice chancellor of research. His many friends and colleagues remember Hess as a “kind and great man.” “We would not be where we are today without Charley’s vision and leadership,” said Dean Helene Dillard, who studied for her advanced degrees at CA&ES during Hess’ time as dean. “Charley was a wonderful colleague, an inspira- tional teacher, a tremendous mentor and a dear friend to our college and the people we serve.” UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 3 ]]></page>

SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES that climate change would alter the rhythms of nature, but just how and when hasn’t been easy to predict. That’s why research, especially long-term research, is so important. At a remote field site in Greenland, Professor Eric Post has studied changes in plant and animal communities for more than a quarter century. The UC Davis wildlife ecologist and his graduate students document how spring is arriving weeks earlier than it used to and what consequences that brings for herbivores like caribou and musk oxen. BRINGING THE SCIENCE BACK HOME Not only is Post’s work shedding light on ecological shifts in the Arctic, but he and colleagues engage young students and their teachers back home to learn about field research taking place at the top of the world. A project called APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning through Engaged Science) shows K-12 teachers, through summer workshops in the U.S., how to deliver lessons about Greenland and climate change. “Over the course of five days, we give them a crash course in climate change, how to teach climate change, how to confront climate change denial, and how we study the effects of climate change in the Arctic,” Post said. “We also give them the materials and methods to replicate what we’re doing back in their own school yards.” More than 30 teachers from 19 states are involved in the program, which continues to grow. Students are able to collect data on the timing of plant growth and share it through the APPLES website. They also have access to the Greenland data Post and his students are collecting and can compare that to their own data. One of the more interesting research tools students get to experiment with is a time-lapse camera, just like the 50 such cameras Post and crew have spread out over 25 square miles of caribou calving range. Within the span of a few 4 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 ]]></page>

A CARIBOU HERD IN DECLINE Perhaps the most dramatic trend the scientists have noticed is how few caribou remain at the study site. From a maximum of about 500 to 600 early on, numbers have dropped in the last three years to less than 100 caribou. The reason for the decline is unclear, but may in part relate to earlier plant growth caused by a warmer climate. Caribou are migratory animals. In Greenland, they remain on the coast until springtime, when the change in day length tells them it’s time to move eastward to their summer range and give birth to their calves. But the “caribou cafeteria” they’re heading to is opening and closing earlier in the year, which is not good news if they arrive late for the buffet. The difference in nutritional content of newly growing plants compared to older plants is taking a toll on reproductive success. “Caribou produce fewer calves and those calves die at a higher rate in earlier green-up years because caribou can’t time their arrival to coincide with the green flush in resources that they need to provision their calves,” Post said. “Yet we can’t say the decline is solely because of climate change, because there are many complex factors affecting this population.” Musk oxen, on the other hand, seem to be faring better. They are already on site and don’t need to migrate to catch the springtime pulse of new plant growth. When the cafeteria opens earlier, that’s a huge benefit for them. One of Post’s graduate students has documented a correlation between advancing spring growth and musk oxen abundance in her master’s thesis. RAMPING UP POLAR STUDIES Post came to UC Davis in 2016 from Penn State, where he was a professor focused on polar science for 16 years. But he has long been drawn to UC Davis. “As far as I’m concerned, this is the best place for environmental research or ecology,” he said. Last year, Post launched the Polar Forum to engage the academic community in this growing field. So far, the forum has been lining up fascinating speakers like Felicity Aston, the first woman to cross Antarctica alone, and Sergey Zimov, a scientist behind the novel Pleistocene Park project in Siberia. He has other projects in the works to grow this international community of polar scientists. A seed grant from UC Davis Global Affairs is bringing the director of the University of Oxford Polar Forum to campus for an exchange of ideas. He would also like to see UC Davis offer a general polar studies course—and ultimately an expanded curriculum. “Research will always be important,” Post said. “But more education and outreach are needed because that’s the first step in mitigation or adaptation to climate change.” • Jeff Kerby, a former doctoral student in the Post lab, installs a time-lapse camera on a caribou calving range near Kangerlussuaa, Greenland. Assisting him is Ellorie McKnight, a student volunteer from Canada. Since 2012, 50 such cameras distributed throughout the long-term study site have been snapping five photos daily and capturing detailed information on trends in the timing of snow seasonality and plant green-up as the climate warms.

	<page pageNumber="8"><![CDATA[QUANTIFYING By Diane Nelson Researchers from the Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab are studying aspirations and poverty dynamics throughout the world, including in rural Nepal where many families live on less than $1.25 a day. 6 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 in the world live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. Interventions usually focus on providing tangible resources, such as access to clean water, nutrition, health care, education and a viable income. But new research from economists in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences highlights a psychological asset that could be equally important: hope. “Hope alone won’t solve global MORE THAN 800 MILLION PEOPLE Hope might seem like the business of philosophers and motivational speakers. But economists, too, are exploring the power of aspirations. poverty,” said Professor Michael Carter, economist and director of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access at UC Davis. “But other interventions may be more successful if they recognize the vital role that hope can play.” CLOSING YOUR EYES ON A DISMAL FUTURE Planning for the future can improve economic prospects. But planning requires optimism in order to set a goal, ]]></page>

The poorest of the poor didn’t look very far ahead. “When you’re worried about what your family will eat tomorrow, you’re not thinking about whether your child will get into secondary school,” Carter said. “Closing your eyes on a gloomy future can reduce psychological distress at the cost of worsening your prospects for economic well-being.” Economic interventions can raise aspirations. Researchers offered some Mozambique farmers a one-time voucher for maize seeds and fertilizer. The farmers who used the subsidy expanded both their farming operations and their outlook on life. “It appears that hope and planning can coevolve with relaxation of economic constraints,” Carter said. PRANAYA STHAPIT/Interdisciplinary Analysts see a pathway and believe you have the power to take those steps. For people trapped in poverty, the future may be too dark to see. “We stop wanting what we can’t have,” Carter explained. “Otherwise, it’s too painful.” Researchers at the Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access recently looked at aspirations among a group of poor farmers in Mozambique. To gauge farmers’ “time horizon,” researchers asked participants how far out they WHEN INTERNAL CONSTRAINTS PERSIST Sometimes, however, hopelessness continues even after conditions change. “When people are subjected to external constraints long enough, they can internalize those limitations,” said Professor Travis Lybbert, a development economist and researcher with the Innovation Lab. “A person’s perception of her own power can become so degraded that she isn’t able to take advantage of opportunities.” In a recent experiment in Oaxaca, Mexico, Lybbert and his colleagues addressed those internal issues and were able to help clients of a microcredit bank expand their horizons. Lybbert’s team created and then showed a documentary to 326 indigenous women who were eligible for small loans from a community bank. The 15-minute film featured four women who used similar loans to successfully grow small enterprises such as clothing stalls and food stands to help their families thrive. “Seeing women like them succeed opened their eyes to what they could accomplish, too,” Lybbert said. After viewing the documentary, the women took part in a year-long program where they set goals, discussed hopes and fears, and charted a course out of poverty. “We find inspiration from people who are like us,” Lybbert said. “It expands our notion of what we think is possible.” WIDENING THE LENS Lybbert is also conducting research in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. More than 75 percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, and yet many of them spend much of their meager wages on the lottery. That might seem like self-defeating behavior, but when everyone around you is trapped in poverty, winning the lotto can look like the only way out. “It’s important to view behavior through the eyes of the people making the decisions,” Lybbert said. “That’s one of the key insights from this research. It provides perspective and enriches our understanding. When we recognize people’s internal and external constraints, we’re better able to understand what works to alleviate poverty.” Carter and his team recently began a five-year project in Kenya to measure the role that hope plays in poor farmers’ lives. His team is also weighing whether adding a “hope curriculum” to an asset transfer program in Peru will increase its impact. “We’re looking at whether improving the mental health of one person has a spillover effect that can benefit families and communities,” Carter said. “Poverty can set up a self-reinforcing loop of stress and despair. By addressing economic circumstances, as well as outlook, perhaps we can help turn a downward spiral into an upward path.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 7 ]]></page>

It usually starts early in life and can limit educational, economic and social opportunities. Early intervention can help doctors prevent and treat depression, but there isn’t a good screening tool, and most of what we know about depression is based on clinical trials in high- income countries where only a small percentage of young people live. “My colleague calls it the 10-90 divide,” said Johnna Swartz, an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Human Ecology. “Ninety percent of people under the age of 18 live in low- and middle-income countries, but only 10 percent of the research has been done there.” Swartz is part of an international team of experts working to identify and address depression in young people throughout the world. They are collecting brain images, assessing environmental risk factors and gathering biological data from adolescents in Brazil, Nigeria, Nepal and the United Kingdom, as well as in Davis, California. The team will synthesize the data to discover universal and specific risk factors for depression in young people. ]]></page>
	<page pageNumber="11"><![CDATA[By Diane Nelson “Our goal is to improve access to services that help detect risk for depression, provide early intervention and improve quality of life no matter where you live,” Swartz explained. BRAIN IMAGING IN BRAZIL The research group is called IDEA—Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence—and represents a wide range of disciplines. Swartz specializes in the neurobiological and environmental factors that contribute to the risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Swartz has shown that certain brain activity can predict susceptibility to psychiatric conditions, and that both nature and nurture play a role in how people process stressful situations. Swartz and her colleagues have linked childhood poverty to changes in gene expression, brain function and the likelihood of developing depression. “The small, daily challenges of scraping by can build up and affect child development,” Swartz explained. In the current project, Swartz is expanding her research internationally. Working with child psychiatrist Christian Kieling from Brazil, Swartz is collecting brain scans of about 100 teenagers in Porto Alegre, Brazil, analyzing the teen’s brain activity in response to both threatening and positive stimuli. “In previous experiments in the U.S., we found that children with higher activity in the emotion regions of the brain and more blunted activity in the areas that process pleasure are more at risk for depression,” Swartz said. “These first-ever tests with teens in Brazil will help us see if those basic brain networks behave in the same way.” Researchers show teens pictures of angry or fearful faces to measure brain response to threatening stimuli. To test activity in the “reward” circuitry, the children play a computer game in the scanner that lets them win money. “Money usually activates the pleasure regions of the brain,” Swartz explained. For comparative analysis, Swartz will conduct similar brain scans with about 100 young people ages 12 to 15 in Davis later this year. She and her team are currently recruiting participants. DEVELOPING A SCREENING TOOL A simple blood test can tell doctors whether a patient is at risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and many other conditions, but there is no similar screening tool for depression. So Swartz and her team are working to develop one by identifying inflammatory “markers” in our blood stream. “We know that many things like diet, exercise, stress and air pollution can affect inflammation in our systems, which can affect brain function,” Swartz said. “We don’t yet have data to show how inflammation affects developing brain function in teens.” Swartz’ team will analyze the teens’ blood samples along with brain scans to look for correlations between levels of inflammation, brain activity and risk for depression. “Finding those connections can lead to a basic screening tool to help doctors treat and prevent depression before symptoms become chronic and disruptive in young people’s lives,” Swartz said. IDEA’s two-year project is funded by a $2 million grant from MQ, a mental-health charity based in the United Kingdom. Together, the team will be gathering data from people ages 10 to 24 living in various low- and middle-income neighborhoods— from villages in Nigeria and Nepal to cities in Brazil. “By comparing data from adolescents in different countries and settings, we can better understand the cultural, social, genetic and environmental factors that can lead to depression,” Swartz said. “And that understanding can improve treatment, prevention and quality of life for people throughout the world.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 9 ]]></page>

Howe may whip up carrot-top pesto, for example, or beet-greens sauté or some other dish from ingredients other people might throw away. “I’m a huge proponent of ‘root-to-leaf’ cooking, where we look more creatively and sustainably at the foods right in front of us instead of tossing them,” said Howe, who is a master’s student in International Agriculture Development. “Root-to-leaf cooking nourishes us and helps reduce food waste.” Howe is passionate about sustainable diets—foods that support both human and environmental health—and she shares that commitment with people around the world. Last summer, for example, she spent two weeks as part of a Feed the Future WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY DINE 10 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 Innovation Lab for Horticulture project with farmers in Ethiopia, sharing ideas on how to harvest, prepare and enjoy sweet potato leaves. “Before our project, most farmers didn’t know sweet potato leaves were edible and only used them as feed for animals or to propagate plants,” Howe said. “But after one taste, they were convinced. I love it when you can open people’s eyes to food they might otherwise overlook, especially when you can cultivate community along the way.” Linking students with local farmers In addition to her master’s studies, Howe works as a graduate student researcher with the Horticulture Innovation Lab at UC Davis, which advances fruit and vegetable innovations to empower smallholder farmers to earn more income while better nourishing their communities. At the horticulture lab, she manages the Trellis Fund, a program that links U.S. graduate students with local organizations to address horticultural challenges in developing countries. In the last two years, Howe has coordinated 15 Trellis Fund projects in six countries. One of those projects was led by a nonprofit group called Send a Cow Ethiopia. Howe traveled as a student fellow to southern Ethiopia in August 2018 to work with Send a Cow to help small farmers see sweet potato leaves in a new culinary light. “I was really excited when I heard about this project because I, too, didn’t know sweet potato leaves were edible,” Howe said. “I learned something new!” ‘Blind’ taste test Sweet potatoes are a staple in many Ethiopian communities, but most farmers don’t consider eating the leaves. ]]></page>
	<page pageNumber="13"><![CDATA[Lauren Howe gathered with about 25 farmers in the Ukara community of Ethiopia to harvest and taste sweet potato leaves, which are a drought- tolerant alternative to kale, spinach and other greens. Courtesy photo through sustainable food For greens, they grow crops like cabbage and kale. “We normally only think about eating the tuber, but the sweet potato leaves are tasty and nutritious and can be harvested in small quantities during the growing season without harming sweet-potato development,” Howe said. “They are drought-tolerant and available during the dry season when farmers can’t grow kale and other leafy greens, so they are a climate-friendly crop.” Seeing is believing, so Howe set up a workshop with about 25 farmers in the Gurumo Koysha community to harvest and taste the leaves. Together, they cooked the leaves with a bit of oil, onions, garlic, green chilis, cardamom and salt and compared them in flavor to freshly cooked kale. “My plan was to set up a blind taste test, but most of the farmers were involved in the cooking so they knew what they were tasting,” Howe said. “And everyone shared their opinion out loud, so we couldn’t collect private feedback. But it was a very lively form of outreach.” And the consensus was overwhelming: Sweet potato leaves are yummy. “They taste mild, kind of like spinach, but with a little bit of a starchy texture,” Howe said. “The farmers said they would absolutely incorporate sweet potato leaves into their diets. Some farmers, in fact, prepared them for their families that very night.” Slow food at its best Before entering graduate school at UC Davis, Howe worked in Denver for Slow Food USA, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable diets, local food, traditional cooking and community. She and her partner, Dain Holland, met through their shared love for the Slow Food movement and still celebrate it in their lives today. Holland is a sous chef for UC Davis Student Housing and Dining Services and manages on-campus eateries at the Silo, like Gunrock Pub. In Ethiopia, Howe felt the power of the slow food philosophy. “Food is truly a universal language, and the act of cooking and eating transcends culture,” she said. “Ultimately, this project was about gathering families, friends and neighbors to a communal meal— already a strong practice in Ethiopia— to share stories, experiences and hopes for the future. What matters is that people can sit together, enjoy a culinary discovery and be fully supported by their community.” —Diane Nelson UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 11 ]]></page>

	<page pageNumber="16"><![CDATA[Farm Labor Supply from Mexico is Falling Fast By Diane Nelson FOR DECADES, FARMERS in the United States have depended on people from foreign countries—mostly Mexico—to work in the fields. Only two percent of California’s farmworkers were born in the U.S. But Mexico is changing. Fertility rates are falling, rural education is rising, and fewer young people have the need or interest to come to America to pick crops. California’s farm-labor supply from Mexico has been decreasing for several years. New data from a long-term study by UC Davis researchers suggests that supply will soon disappear. “The flow of abundant labor from Mexico is coming to an end,” said Professor J. Edward Taylor, an agricultural economist and co-author of a farm-labor report commissioned by the USDA. “Our research showed loud and clear that changes in immigration policy like expanding the guest-worker program would be a stop-gap solution at best. Farmworkers from Mexico are 14 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 aging out and fewer young workers are interested in migrating in.” It will be politically and logistically hard for farmers to find plentiful, low- wage labor from other regions. Most developing countries are either too small, too far away or urbanizing too quickly. Also, Mexico’s agriculture industry is growing rapidly, attracting workers from Guatemala and other countries who might otherwise be driven to harvest crops in America. The changes create challenges for U.S. agriculture. UC Davis researchers are developing mechanized harvesters, robotic weeders and other technologies to help farmers produce more food with fewer workers. The new machines and management practices require skilled labor, which Taylor says could ultimately benefit farming and farmworkers. “The demand for more skilled workers means rising productivity and wages,” he explained. “And that could be good for rural communities.” Reverse migration By the mid-20th century, most Americans no longer worked in the fields. U.S. growers turned to Mexico to bolster their supply of farm labor. Some farmworkers arrived on temporary work visas and others crossed the border through authorized and unauthorized immigration. For decades, this flow of low-wage labor helped U.S. growers increase production of fruits, vegetables and other crops. But the pace of immigration has slowed dramatically. Between 2007 and 2015, the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. declined 19 percent—from 6.9 million to 5.6 million. Researchers say more unauthorized immigrants are returning to Mexico than entering America. Taylor and his team conducted surveys with a nationally representative sample of 2,000 rural Mexican families, collecting data dating back to the 1980s. They found clear trends to explain ]]></page>
	<page pageNumber="17"><![CDATA[NNEHRING/iStock the decline. Families are having fewer children, more villages are building secondary schools and the non- agriculture economy is growing. Taylor calculates that the number of potential immigrants from rural Mexico drops by about 150,000 people every year, and U.S. growers compete with farmers in Mexico for that shrinking pool. “What was happening in America in the 1900s is happening now in Mexico,” Taylor said. “As incomes go up, the share of workforce in agriculture plummets. Kids in Mexico are like any other kids with smart phones and Instagram. Are you really going to convince them to go out and pick lettuce?” A new paradigm Signs of a tightening farm labor market are already here. Over the last 10 years, farmworker wages have risen, the gap between agricultural and nonagricultural pay has narrowed and farmers’ use of guest-worker programs has doubled. Some farmers would like an expanded guest-worker program, but Taylor predicts that would provide only temporary relief. “Immigration policy can’t solve the problem if workers don’t want to work in agriculture,” he said. Mechanization and management efficiency may be the key. “Farmers will have to produce more with less,” Taylor said. “That’s the bottom line.” Some growers have already switched from labor-intensive crops like peaches to crops that are harvested by machines, such as almonds. UC Davis researchers are developing technology and management practices that mechanize the care and harvest of many other crops, such as strawberries, lettuce and grapes. They are even creating tractors that can distinguish a weed from a budding crop so farmers can mechanize labor-intensive tasks like weeding. Technology requires skilled labor, and Taylor emphasizes that the U.S. “ Our research showed loud and clear that changes in immigration policy like expanding the guest-worker program would be a stop-gap solution at best. Farmworkers from Mexico are aging out and fewer young workers are interested in migrating in. ” will have to properly educate tomorrow’s farm workforce. “Either that, or import it from Mexico,” he said. “Mexico graduates more engineers per capita than the United States. Will we see an expansion of skilled farm labor migration in the future?” In any case, Taylor sees a silver lining for agriculture and farm labor. “Fewer workers and higher productivity means good wages and more efficient food production. That’s a good thing.” • UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 15 ]]></page>

The answer will help conservationists protect wildlife as the Earth’s temperatures rise and rainforests give way to livestock production and other agricultural uses. To gather clues, ecology graduate student Alison Ke spent last summer exploring bird communities and vegetation along remote, rugged terrain in Colombia, home to nearly 2,000 bird species. She learned a lot about bird conservation—planting large trees on grazing land might bolster bird communities, for example. And she discovered an essential truth: International research can be grueling. In the course of her 10-week travel, Ke bathed in a river with alligators, fell into a swamp, got shocked by an electric fence and shared her tent site with pigs, wasps and chickens who liked to hang out in the tent fly. She learned that mosquitoes can bite through two pair of pants. She drank water so dirty it stung her throat, and she needed a machete to reach some of the 144 sites she navigated in predawn heat. And she had the time of her life. “Every day was a new adventure!” exclaimed Ke, a Ph.D. student working with Daniel Karp, an assistant professor in wildlife, fish and conservation biology. “I got to ride on mules and 16 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 swim in a river with a giant rainbow over my head. I met wonderful people and experienced new cultures. I learned how to tolerate physical and mental discomfort and stay optimistic, which is something I’ll never forget.” Protecting biodiversity The ultimate goal of Ke’s project is to protect biodiversity, or diverse biological species, which the planet depends on for clean air and water, fertile soil, flood control and so much more. Each of the millions of living things on Earth have evolved to thrive in its own ecological niche with certain temperatures and sources of food. Changes in climate and land use can wipe out habitat or alter it faster than species can migrate or adapt. When a plant, animal or other organism becomes extinct—a condition on the rise—it impacts the entire ecosystem and takes with it a unique genetic code often needed to develop medicines and foods. Colombia’s Magdalena Valley is an area rich in rainforest and biodiversity that is threatened by major changes in climate and land use. Along with Professor Karp, Ke is studying one of those diverse biological groups—tropical birds—to better understand why some organisms are more vulnerable to extinction when the conditions around them change.

Colombia is home to nearly 2,000 species of birds, including the bare-faced ibis (above), which Ke observed in Santander, Colombia. A whole new world Based on preliminary observations, Ke thinks that large, long-lived, non-migratory birds will have the most trouble surviving global change. “If that’s true, then land-use and climate change will likely increase the number of shared species throughout the tropics, homogenizing ecological communities and reducing overall biodiversity.” This summer, a scientist from Colombia will trek through the region to build on Ke’s research. Meanwhile, Ke will spend the summer in Ecuador, installing nesting boxes in forests and on farms to see how global change affects nesting habits. Once again, Ke will be off to explore a whole new world. • View more photos at caes.ucdavis.edu/news/ colombia “We’re looking at which traits are shared by species that can and can’t survive so we can reduce the risks birds face from global change.” ALISON KE/UC Davis From June to August 2018, Ke chronicled birds and vegetation in both agricultural and forested settings in 12 distinct locations in Colombia’s Magdalena Valley, from sprawling cattle ranches to ecotourism lodges to sustenance farms. Each morning, she awoke in a field or a farmhouse by 4:30 a.m. so she could drive, hike, boat or ride a horse or mule to that day’s test site and arrive before dawn. “That’s when the birds were most active and the heat and humidity were most manageable,” Ke explained. From about 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., she would climb mountains and ford streams to record bird sights and sounds at various locales on that day’s site. She usually took a break in the afternoon when temperatures climbed above 94 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity hovered near 95 percent. After about 2:30 p.m., she would return to measure the density of the ground cover, bushes and trees so she could link bird species to the environment they prefer. Some days, Ke was joined by a fellow scientist. Every day, she was accompanied by a Colombian guide. And every day, she experienced something new. “Whether I was crossing a river on a bamboo raft or eating guavas fresh from the tree, I was exploring places foreigners generally don’t go.” UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 17 ]]></page>

Cool storage can greatly reduce these losses, but is virtually non-existent in many places because of high equip- ment costs. The CoolBot is one option for reducing the costs of a cold room, using a device that tricks an air conditioner into further reducing temperatures in a well-insulated room. CA&ES manages four of the U.S. government’s Feed the Future Innovation Labs. These labs draw on the expertise of top U.S. colleges and universities in collaboration with research and educational institutions in developing countries to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges in agriculture, food security and nutrition. In addition to the Horticulture Innovation Lab, the other three include: The Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab utilizes financial, behavioral and informa- tional innovations to help farmers. The goal is to better understand roadblocks that keep farmers from adopting new technologies and to design strategies and programs that close yield gaps, increase productivity and secure more sustainable livelihoods. The Genomics to Improve Poultry Innovation Lab is working to reduce limitations to poultry production by applying advanced genetics and genomic approaches to enhance innate resistance to Newcastle disease and tolerance to heat stress in chickens in parts of the world where this disease and hot climates are prevalent.

Green. Many of the people in this photo founded the Green Fellowship and SLLC Program Fund. Green Fellowship Alumni join together to build support for sustainability efforts on campus is its commitment to sustainability, social justice and student involvement. Thanks to a growing group of more than 20 alumni, that commitment will continue to flourish with an innovative fundraising effort. Most of these alums experienced common ground working at the Student Farm, living at the Domes, or helping organize the Whole Earth Festival (which celebrates its 50th anniversary in May). Each member of this group pledged financial support to create a “Green Fellowship” for undergraduates and also for improvements to that part of campus known as the Sustainable Living and Learning Communities (SLLC). “We launched this campaign to encourage student-led efforts advancing social justice and sustainability,” said a lead donor, Poppy Davis (’88, agricultural and managerial economics). “One of the most important things we got from our time at UC Davis was our friendships, and that connectedness helped us get involved in causes we care about. We want to see that tradition continue.” The Green Fellowships will give students more freedom to explore their ideas. Each fellowship includes direct financial support for student fees and supplemental support to purchase ONE OF THE THINGS UC DAVIS IS KNOWN FOR supplies and cover expenses. The first two Green Fellowship recipients are communications major Christopher Almaraz and sustainable environmental design major Aina Smart Truco, who delved into the history of student activism at UC Davis. They will share what they discovered at an open house for donors and alumni at the SLLC during the Whole Earth Festival. Future Green Fellowship recipients will focus on interdisciplinary projects that benefit SLLC programs, such as the Student Farm, Project Compost, the Experimental Community Garden and alternative student housing at the Domes and the Tri-Cooperatives. The donors also believe infrastructure improvements and modernizing SLLC facilities will greatly enhance opportunities for experiential learning, internships and, ultimately, jobs. “We want to achieve long-term institutional support for the Sustainable Living and Learning Communities and to help students focus on relationships and community, not just their studies,” Davis said. “Living and working in community helped define our college experience and shape the direction of our lives. We want to give a new generation the same opportunities.” GOING GREEN The goal of this initiative is to raise at least $40,000 for each of the next five years, with 70 percent designated for the Green Fellowships and 30 percent designated for the SLLC improve- ment fund. Building support for the Sustain- able Living and Learning Communities through this and related efforts is an important goal of the college.

Instead, he embarked on a rewarding career improving livestock both in the U.S. and in the developing world. “Animal science is incredibly broad,” Rothschild “It’s the cheapest way to said. “There is enormous reduce conflict, war and opportunity for students in disease, and it would be a animal agriculture.” mistake not to invest in it The distinguished professor at Iowa State University helped every day.” pioneer the application of molecular genetics to livestock improvement. His work on swine transformed industry breeding practices through the identification of genes that control reproduction, growth and meat quality. About 90 percent of the pigs produced in the U.S. today come from breeding stock developed through his genetic tests. Rothschild traces the roots of his success DOROTHY MASINDE/Iowa State University to his time as an undergraduate at UC Davis, where animal science professors Eric Bradford and Bob Laben helped him understand animal genetics and encouraged him to pursue graduate school. “Besides being great instructors and advisors,” he said, “they were just super human beings who helped me develop my interest in livestock.” MAX ROTHSCHILD (’74, ANIMAL SCIENCE) He also met his wife and greatest supporter, Denise Fried Rothschild (’75, biology), at UC Davis. A new frontier in Rothschild’s career opened 15 years ago during a visit to the Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods in Uganda. “This was a pivotal moment for me because I realized how much genetic improvement is afforded only to those who have great production to start with,” he said. Rothschild worked with Ugandan farmers to improve basic capabilities for raising livestock, primarily goats, pigs and chickens. “Working there breaks all your preconceived notions about livestock production,” he said. “What we take for granted—shelter, climate control, water, feed, quality animals—you don’t see that in some villages.” Rothschild’s work in Africa and beyond has given him a deep appreciation for the overseas efforts of universities like Iowa State and UC Davis. He has traveled to more than 65 countries—from Thailand to Costa Rica— to share his knowledge of modern animal science techniques. “There’s a lot of talk about whether we should do foreign aid or not,” he said. “It’s the cheapest way to reduce conflict, war and disease, and it would be a mistake not to invest in it every day.” Rothschild encourages students to keep an open mind and be willing to explore the many career paths in animal science. “Take a lot of courses and internships. Talk to your professors. And think internationally because that’s where tremendous growth will be in the years ahead. It’s a big world out there.” —John Stumbos Professor Max Rothschild works with a local student to build a pig enclosure for farmers in Kamuli, Uganda. 24 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019 ]]></page>
