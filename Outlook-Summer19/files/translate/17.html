<br>
the decline. Families are having fewer
<br>
children, more villages are building
<br>
secondary schools and the non-
<br>
agriculture economy is growing.
<br>
<br>
Taylor calculates that the number
<br>
of potential immigrants from rural
<br>
Mexico drops by about 150,000 people
<br>
every year, and U.S. growers compete with
<br>
farmers in Mexico for that shrinking pool.
<br>
<br>
“What was happening in America in
<br>
the 1900s is happening now in Mexico,”
<br>
Taylor said. “As incomes go up, the share
<br>
of workforce in agriculture plummets.
<br>
<br>
Kids in Mexico are like any other kids
<br>
with smart phones and Instagram. Are
<br>
you really going to convince them to go
<br>
out and pick lettuce?”
<br>
A new paradigm
<br>
Signs of a tightening farm labor
<br>
market are already here. Over the
<br>
last 10 years, farmworker wages have
<br>
risen, the gap between agricultural and
<br>
nonagricultural pay has narrowed and
<br>
farmers’ use of guest-worker programs
<br>
has doubled. Some farmers would like
<br>
an expanded guest-worker program, but
<br>
Taylor predicts that would provide only
<br>
temporary relief.
<br>
<br>
“Immigration policy can’t solve the
<br>
problem if workers don’t want to work in
<br>
agriculture,” he said.
<br>
<br>
Mechanization and management
<br>
efficiency may be the key. “Farmers will
<br>
have to produce more with less,” Taylor
<br>
said. “That’s the bottom line.”
<br>
Some growers have already switched
<br>
from labor-intensive crops like peaches
<br>
to crops that are harvested by machines,
<br>
such as almonds.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis researchers are developing
<br>
technology and management practices
<br>
that mechanize the care and harvest of
<br>
many other crops, such as strawberries,
<br>
lettuce and grapes. They are even creating
<br>
tractors that can distinguish a weed from
<br>
a budding crop so farmers can mechanize
<br>
labor-intensive tasks like weeding.
<br>
<br>
Technology requires skilled labor,
<br>
and Taylor emphasizes that the U.S.
<br>
<br>
“ Our research showed loud and
<br>
clear that changes in immigration
<br>
policy like expanding the
<br>
guest-worker program would
<br>
be a stop-gap solution at best.
<br>
<br>
Farmworkers from Mexico are
<br>
aging out and fewer young
<br>
workers are interested in
<br>
migrating in.
<br>
<br>
” will have to properly educate tomorrow’s
<br>
farm workforce.
<br>
<br>
“Either that, or import it from
<br>
Mexico,” he said. “Mexico graduates
<br>
more engineers per capita than the
<br>
United States. Will we see an expansion
<br>
of skilled farm labor migration in
<br>
the future?”
<br>
In any case, Taylor sees a silver lining
<br>
for agriculture and farm labor. “Fewer
<br>
workers and higher productivity means
<br>
good wages and more efficient food
<br>
production. That’s a good thing.”
