and every plant, all under the
<br>
same roof. Five of the new
<br>
greenhouses will be completed
<br>
later in 2019 and more are on
<br>
the way. The new greenhouses
<br>
will create lab space for public
<br>
breeding, teaching and research
<br>
on a diverse array of plant
<br>
species, including cacao,
<br>
which is rarely studied at
<br>
public institutions.

The college recently broke
<br>
ground on next-level
<br>
greenhouses, which will support
<br>
innovative research to keep
<br>
plants plentiful, nutritious

and resilient. The state-of-the-

researchers to precisely control

For Professor Anita Oberbauer, good teaching
<br>
begins and ends with inquisitive students. “The
<br>
students’ curiosity, questions and interest build
<br>
that desire to become a better instructor,” said
<br>
Oberbauer, an associate dean and expert in animal
<br>
science. Oberbauer recently received the 2018-19
<br>
UC Davis Prize for Undergraduate Teaching and
<br>
Scholarly Achievement. The prize comes with a
<br>
$50,000 award, which Oberbauer promptly used
<br>
to create a $50,000 scholarship fund for students
<br>
studying companion animals. Oberbauer, who
<br>
students fondly call “Dr. O,” was praised for her
<br>
innovative instruction and curriculum, especially
<br>
in the field of companion animals.
