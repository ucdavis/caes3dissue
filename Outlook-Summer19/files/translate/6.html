news/apples. SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES that
<br>
climate change would alter the rhythms of
<br>
nature, but just how and when hasn’t been easy to
<br>
predict. That’s why research, especially long-term
<br>
research, is so important.
<br>
<br>
At a remote field site in Greenland, Professor
<br>
Eric Post has studied changes in plant and animal
<br>
communities for more than a quarter century.
<br>
<br>
The UC Davis wildlife ecologist and his graduate
<br>
students document how spring is arriving weeks
<br>
earlier than it used to and what consequences that
<br>
brings for herbivores like caribou and musk oxen.
<br>
<br>
BRINGING THE SCIENCE BACK HOME
<br>
Not only is Post’s work shedding light on
<br>
ecological shifts in the Arctic, but he and
<br>
colleagues engage young students and their
<br>
teachers back home to learn about field research
<br>
taking place at the top of the world. A project
<br>
called APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning
<br>
through Engaged Science) shows K-12 teachers,
<br>
through summer workshops in the U.S., how to
<br>
deliver lessons about Greenland and climate change.
<br>
<br>
“Over the course of five days, we give them
<br>
a crash course in climate change, how to teach
<br>
climate change, how to confront climate change
<br>
denial, and how we study the effects of climate
<br>
change in the Arctic,” Post said. “We also give
<br>
them the materials and methods to replicate what
<br>
we’re doing back in their own school yards.”
<br>
More than 30 teachers from 19 states are
<br>
involved in the program, which continues to grow.
<br>
<br>
Students are able to collect data on the timing
<br>
of plant growth and share it through the APPLES
<br>
website. They also have access to the Greenland
<br>
data Post and his students are collecting and can
<br>
compare that to their own data.
<br>
<br>
One of the more interesting research tools
<br>
students get to experiment with is a time-lapse
<br>
camera, just like the 50 such cameras Post and
<br>
crew have spread out over 25 square miles of
<br>
caribou calving range. Within the span of a few
