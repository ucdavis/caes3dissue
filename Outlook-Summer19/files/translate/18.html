WHY DO SOME TROPICAL BIRDS ADAPT BETTER
<br>
than others to changes in climate and land use?
<br>
The answer will help conservationists protect
<br>
wildlife as the Earth’s temperatures rise and
<br>
rainforests give way to livestock production
<br>
and other agricultural uses.
<br>
<br>
To gather clues, ecology graduate student
<br>
Alison Ke spent last summer exploring bird
<br>
communities and vegetation along remote,
<br>
rugged terrain in Colombia, home to nearly
<br>
2,000 bird species. She learned a lot about bird
<br>
conservation—planting large trees on grazing
<br>
land might bolster bird communities,
<br>
for example. And she discovered an essential
<br>
truth: International research can be grueling.
<br>
<br>
In the course of her 10-week travel, Ke bathed
<br>
in a river with alligators, fell into a swamp, got
<br>
shocked by an electric fence and shared her tent
<br>
site with pigs, wasps and chickens who liked
<br>
to hang out in the tent fly. She learned that
<br>
mosquitoes can bite through two pair of pants.
<br>
<br>
She drank water so dirty it stung her throat,
<br>
and she needed a machete to reach some of the
<br>
144 sites she navigated in predawn heat.
<br>
<br>
And she had the time of her life.
<br>
<br>
“Every day was a new adventure!” exclaimed
<br>
Ke, a Ph.D. student working with Daniel Karp,
<br>
an assistant professor in wildlife, fish and
<br>
conservation biology. “I got to ride on mules and
<br>

<br>
swim in a river with a giant rainbow over my
<br>
head. I met wonderful people and experienced
<br>
new cultures. I learned how to tolerate physical
<br>
and mental discomfort and stay optimistic,
<br>
which is something I’ll never forget.”
<br>
Protecting biodiversity
<br>
The ultimate goal of Ke’s project is to protect
<br>
biodiversity, or diverse biological species, which
<br>
the planet depends on for clean air and water,
<br>
fertile soil, flood control and so much more.
<br>
<br>
Each of the millions of living things on Earth
<br>
have evolved to thrive in its own ecological
<br>
niche with certain temperatures and sources of
<br>
food. Changes in climate and land use can wipe
<br>
out habitat or alter it faster than species can
<br>
migrate or adapt. When a plant, animal or other
<br>
organism becomes extinct—a condition on the
<br>
rise—it impacts the entire ecosystem and takes
<br>
with it a unique genetic code often needed to
<br>
develop medicines and foods.
<br>
<br>
Colombia’s Magdalena Valley is an area rich
<br>
in rainforest and biodiversity that is threatened
<br>
by major changes in climate and land use. Along
<br>
with Professor Karp, Ke is studying one of those
<br>
diverse biological groups—tropical birds—to
<br>
better understand why some organisms are more
<br>
vulnerable to extinction when the conditions
<br>
around them change.
