THE STUDENT STORY
<br>
at graduate student Lauren Howe’s home,
<br>
they know they will enjoy something
<br>
tasty, healthy and new. Howe may whip
<br>
up carrot-top pesto, for example, or
<br>
beet-greens sauté or some other dish
<br>
from ingredients other people might
<br>
throw away.
<br>
<br>
“I’m a huge proponent of ‘root-to-leaf’
<br>
cooking, where we look more creatively
<br>
and sustainably at the foods right in
<br>
front of us instead of tossing them,”
<br>
said Howe, who is a master’s student in
<br>
International Agriculture Development.
<br>
<br>
“Root-to-leaf cooking nourishes us and
<br>
helps reduce food waste.”
<br>
Howe is passionate about sustainable
<br>
diets—foods that support both human
<br>
and environmental health—and she
<br>
shares that commitment with people
<br>
around the world.
<br>
<br>
Last summer, for example, she spent
<br>
two weeks as part of a Feed the Future
<br>
WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY DINE
<br>
10 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019
<br>
Innovation Lab for Horticulture project
<br>
with farmers in Ethiopia, sharing ideas
<br>
on how to harvest, prepare and enjoy
<br>
sweet potato leaves.
<br>
<br>
“Before our project, most farmers
<br>
didn’t know sweet potato leaves were
<br>
edible and only used them as feed for
<br>
animals or to propagate plants,” Howe
<br>
said. “But after one taste, they were
<br>
convinced. I love it when you can
<br>
open people’s eyes to food they might
<br>
otherwise overlook, especially when you
<br>
can cultivate community along the way.”
<br>
Linking students with local farmers
<br>
In addition to her master’s studies,
<br>
Howe works as a graduate student
<br>
researcher with the Horticulture
<br>
Innovation Lab at UC Davis, which
<br>
advances fruit and vegetable innovations
<br>
to empower smallholder farmers to earn
<br>
more income while better nourishing
<br>
their communities. At the horticulture
<br>
lab, she manages the Trellis Fund,
<br>
a program that links U.S. graduate
<br>
students with local organizations to
<br>
address horticultural challenges in
<br>
developing countries.
<br>
<br>
In the last two years, Howe has
<br>
coordinated 15 Trellis Fund projects
<br>
in six countries. One of those projects
<br>
was led by a nonprofit group called
<br>
Send a Cow Ethiopia. Howe traveled as
<br>
a student fellow to southern Ethiopia in
<br>
August 2018 to work with Send a Cow
<br>
to help small farmers see sweet potato
<br>
leaves in a new culinary light.
<br>
<br>
“I was really excited when I heard
<br>
about this project because I, too, didn’t
<br>
know sweet potato leaves were edible,”
<br>
Howe said. “I learned something new!”
<br>
‘Blind’ taste test
<br>
Sweet potatoes are a staple in many
<br>
Ethiopian communities, but most
<br>
farmers don’t consider eating the leaves.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Lauren Howe gathered with about
<br>
25 farmers in the Ukara community
<br>
of Ethiopia to harvest and taste sweet
<br>
potato leaves, which are a drought-
<br>
tolerant alternative to kale, spinach
<br>
and other greens.

For greens, they grow crops like cabbage
<br>
and kale.
<br>
<br>
“We normally only think about
<br>
eating the tuber, but the sweet potato
<br>
leaves are tasty and nutritious and can
<br>
be harvested in small quantities during
<br>
the growing season without harming
<br>
sweet-potato development,” Howe said.
<br>
<br>
“They are drought-tolerant and available
<br>
during the dry season when farmers
<br>
can’t grow kale and other leafy greens,
<br>
so they are a climate-friendly crop.”
<br>
Seeing is believing, so Howe set up
<br>
a workshop with about 25 farmers in
<br>
the Gurumo Koysha community to
<br>
harvest and taste the leaves. Together,
<br>
they cooked the leaves with a bit of oil,
<br>
onions, garlic, green chilis, cardamom
<br>
and salt and compared them in flavor to
<br>
freshly cooked kale.
<br>
<br>
“My plan was to set up a blind taste
<br>
test, but most of the farmers were
<br>
involved in the cooking so they knew
<br>
what they were tasting,” Howe said.
<br>
<br>
“And everyone shared their opinion
<br>
out loud, so we couldn’t collect private
<br>
feedback. But it was a very lively form of
<br>
outreach.” And the consensus was overwhelming:
<br>
Sweet potato leaves are yummy.
<br>
<br>
“They taste mild, kind of like
<br>
spinach, but with a little bit of a starchy
<br>
texture,” Howe said. “The farmers said
<br>
they would absolutely incorporate sweet
<br>
potato leaves into their diets. Some
<br>
farmers, in fact, prepared them for their
<br>
families that very night.”
<br>
Slow food at its best
<br>
Before entering graduate school at
<br>
UC Davis, Howe worked in Denver
<br>
for Slow Food USA, a nonprofit that
<br>
promotes sustainable diets, local food,
<br>
traditional cooking and community.
<br>
<br>
She and her partner, Dain Holland, met
<br>
through their shared love for the Slow
<br>
Food movement and still celebrate it
<br>
in their lives today. Holland is a sous
<br>
chef for UC Davis Student Housing
<br>
and Dining Services and manages
<br>
on-campus eateries at the Silo, like
<br>
Gunrock Pub.
<br>
<br>
In Ethiopia, Howe felt the power of
<br>
the slow food philosophy.
<br>
<br>
“Food is truly a universal
<br>
language, and the act of cooking
<br>
and eating transcends culture,” she
<br>
said. “Ultimately, this project was
<br>
about gathering families, friends and
<br>
neighbors to a communal meal—
<br>
already a strong practice in Ethiopia—
<br>
to share stories, experiences and hopes
<br>
for the future. What matters is that
<br>
people can sit together, enjoy a culinary
<br>
discovery and be fully supported by
<br>
their community.”
