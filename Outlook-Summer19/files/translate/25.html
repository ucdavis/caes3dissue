<br>
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
<br>
UC Davis alumni who were active in many campus activities in the ’80s gather on campus during Whole Earth 1999 to plant a tree in
<br>
remembrance of their friend Suzanne C. Green. Many of the people in this photo founded the Green Fellowship and SLLC Program Fund.
<br>
<br>
Green Fellowship
<br>
Alumni join together to build support for sustainability efforts on campus
<br>
is its commitment to sustainability, social justice
<br>
and student involvement. Thanks to a growing
<br>
group of more than 20 alumni, that commitment
<br>
will continue to flourish with an innovative
<br>
fundraising effort.
<br>
<br>
Most of these alums experienced common
<br>
ground working at the Student Farm, living at
<br>
the Domes, or helping organize the Whole Earth
<br>
Festival (which celebrates its 50th anniversary
<br>
in May). Each member of this group pledged
<br>
financial support to create a “Green Fellowship”
<br>
for undergraduates and also for improvements
<br>
to that part of campus known as the Sustainable
<br>
Living and Learning Communities (SLLC).
<br>
<br>
“We launched this campaign to encourage
<br>
student-led efforts advancing social justice and
<br>
sustainability,” said a lead donor, Poppy Davis (’88,
<br>
agricultural and managerial economics). “One
<br>
of the most important things we got from our
<br>
time at UC Davis was our friendships, and
<br>
that connectedness helped us get involved in
<br>
causes we care about. We want to see that
<br>
tradition continue.”
<br>
The Green Fellowships will give students more
<br>
freedom to explore their ideas. Each fellowship
<br>
includes direct financial support for student
<br>
fees and supplemental support to purchase
<br>
ONE OF THE THINGS UC DAVIS IS KNOWN FOR
<br>
supplies and cover expenses. The first two Green
<br>
Fellowship recipients are communications
<br>
major Christopher Almaraz and sustainable
<br>
environmental design major Aina Smart Truco,
<br>
who delved into the history of student activism at
<br>
UC Davis. They will share what they discovered
<br>
at an open house for donors and alumni at the
<br>
SLLC during the Whole Earth Festival.
<br>
<br>
Future Green Fellowship recipients will focus
<br>
on interdisciplinary projects that benefit SLLC
<br>
programs, such as the Student Farm, Project
<br>
Compost, the Experimental Community Garden
<br>
and alternative student housing at the Domes and
<br>
the Tri-Cooperatives. The donors also believe
<br>
infrastructure improvements and modernizing
<br>
SLLC facilities will greatly enhance opportunities
<br>
for experiential learning, internships and,
<br>
ultimately, jobs.
<br>
<br>
“We want to achieve long-term institutional
<br>
support for the Sustainable Living and Learning
<br>
Communities and to help students focus on
<br>
relationships and community, not just their
<br>
studies,” Davis said. “Living and working in
<br>
community helped define our college experience
<br>
and shape the direction of our lives. We want to
<br>
give a new generation the same opportunities.”
<br>
GOING GREEN
<br>
The goal of this
<br>
initiative is to raise at
<br>
least $40,000 for each
<br>
of the next five years,
<br>
with 70 percent
<br>
designated for the
<br>
Green Fellowships and
<br>
30 percent designated
<br>
for the SLLC improve-
<br>
ment fund. Building
<br>
support for the Sustain-
<br>
able Living and Learning
<br>
Communities through
<br>
this and related efforts is
<br>
an important goal of the
<br>
college. To learn more
