“Why are some birds unable to persist in
<br>
agricultural landscapes?” Ke asked. “We’re
<br>
looking at which traits are shared by species that
<br>
can and can’t survive so we can reduce the risks
<br>
birds face from global change.”

Loaiza and Colombian under-

graduate student Estefania

Guzman. Colombia is home to
<br>
nearly 2,000 species of birds,
<br>
including the bare-faced ibis
<br>
(above), which Ke observed in
<br>
Santander, Colombia.

A whole new world
<br>
Based on preliminary observations, Ke thinks
<br>
that large, long-lived, non-migratory birds will
<br>
have the most trouble surviving global change.
<br>
<br>
“If that’s true, then land-use and climate change
<br>
will likely increase the number of shared species
<br>
throughout the tropics, homogenizing ecological
<br>
communities and reducing overall biodiversity.”
<br>
This summer, a scientist from Colombia will
<br>
trek through the region to build on Ke’s research.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Ke will spend the summer in
<br>
Ecuador, installing nesting boxes in forests
<br>
and on farms to see how global change affects
<br>
nesting habits.
<br>
<br>
Once again, Ke will be off to explore a whole
<br>
new world.

From June to August 2018, Ke chronicled birds
<br>
and vegetation in both agricultural and forested
<br>
settings in 12 distinct locations in Colombia’s
<br>
Magdalena Valley, from sprawling cattle ranches
<br>
to ecotourism lodges to sustenance farms.
<br>
<br>
Each morning, she awoke in a field or a
<br>
farmhouse by 4:30 a.m. so she could drive, hike,
<br>
boat or ride a horse or mule to that day’s test site
<br>
and arrive before dawn.
<br>
<br>
“That’s when the birds were most active and
<br>
the heat and humidity were most manageable,”
<br>
Ke explained.
<br>
<br>
From about 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., she would climb
<br>
mountains and ford streams to record bird sights
<br>
and sounds at various locales on that day’s
<br>
site. She usually took a break in the afternoon
<br>
when temperatures climbed above 94 degrees
<br>
Fahrenheit and humidity
<br>
hovered near 95 percent.
<br>
<br>
After about 2:30 p.m., she
<br>
would return to measure the
<br>
density of the ground cover,
<br>
bushes and trees so she
<br>
could link bird species to the
<br>
environment they prefer.
<br>
<br>
Some days, Ke was joined by a fellow scientist.
<br>
<br>
Every day, she was accompanied by a Colombian
<br>
guide. And every day, she experienced something
<br>
new. “Whether I was crossing a river on a
<br>
bamboo raft or eating guavas fresh from the tree,
<br>
I was exploring places foreigners generally don’t
<br>
go.” UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
