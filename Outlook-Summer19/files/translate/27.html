MATTHEW FINKLE
<br>
Study Abroad!
<br>
Matthew Finkle (’18, environmental policy and planning analysis) traveled to Australia with the UC Davis
<br>
Study Abroad program in what he says was the best educational experience of his undergraduate
<br>
career—fascinating, practical, inspiring and hands on. The program provided a unique opportunity to
<br>
make valuable connections in the scientific community, build great experience conducting scientific
<br>
research in the field, explore classic Australian terrains on class camping and research trips, and study
<br>
the Great Barrier Reef during a critical period of its existence. Learn more: studyabroad.ucdavis.edu
