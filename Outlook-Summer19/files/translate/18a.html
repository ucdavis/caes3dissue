WHY DO SOME TROPICAL BIRDS ADAPT BETTER
<br>
than others to changes in climate and land use?
<br>
The answer will help conservationists protect
<br>
wildlife as the Earth’s temperatures rise and
<br>
rainforests give way to livestock production
<br>
and other agricultural uses.
<br>
<br>
To gather clues, ecology graduate student
<br>
Alison Ke spent last summer exploring bird
<br>
communities and vegetation along remote,
<br>
rugged terrain in Colombia, home to nearly
<br>
2,000 bird species. She learned a lot about bird
<br>
conservation—planting large trees on grazing
<br>
land might bolster bird communities,
<br>
for example. And she discovered an essential
<br>
truth: International research can be grueling.
<br>
<br>
In the course of her 10-week travel, Ke bathed
<br>
in a river with alligators, fell into a swamp, got
<br>
shocked by an electric fence and shared her tent
<br>
site with pigs, wasps and chickens who liked
<br>
to hang out in the tent fly. She learned that
<br>
mosquitoes can bite through two pair of pants.
<br>
<br>
She drank water so dirty it stung her throat,
<br>
and she needed a machete to reach some of the
<br>
144 sites she navigated in predawn heat.
<br>
<br>
And she had the time of her life.
<br>
<br>
“Every day was a new adventure!” exclaimed
<br>
Ke, a Ph.D. student working with Daniel Karp,
<br>
an assistant professor in wildlife, fish and
<br>
conservation biology. “I got to ride on mules and
<br>

<br>
swim in a river with a giant rainbow over my
<br>
head. I met wonderful people and experienced
<br>
new cultures. I learned how to tolerate physical
<br>
and mental discomfort and stay optimistic,
<br>
which is something I’ll never forget.”
<br>
Protecting biodiversity
<br>
The ultimate goal of Ke’s project is to protect
<br>
biodiversity, or diverse biological species, which
<br>
the planet depends on for clean air and water,
<br>
fertile soil, flood control and so much more.
<br>
<br>
Each of the millions of living things on Earth
<br>
have evolved to thrive in its own ecological
<br>
niche with certain temperatures and sources of
<br>
food. Changes in climate and land use can wipe
<br>
out habitat or alter it faster than species can
<br>
migrate or adapt. When a plant, animal or other
<br>
organism becomes extinct—a condition on the
<br>
rise—it impacts the entire ecosystem and takes
<br>
with it a unique genetic code often needed to
<br>
develop medicines and foods.
<br>
<br>
Colombia’s Magdalena Valley is an area rich
<br>
in rainforest and biodiversity that is threatened
<br>
by major changes in climate and land use. Along
<br>
with Professor Karp, Ke is studying one of those
<br>
diverse biological groups—tropical birds—to
<br>
better understand why some organisms are more
<br>
vulnerable to extinction when the conditions
<br>
around them change.
<br>
<br>
Adapting to change
<br>

<br>
“Why are some birds unable to persist in
<br>
agricultural landscapes?” Ke asked. “We’re
<br>
looking at which traits are shared by species that
<br>
can and can’t survive so we can reduce the risks
<br>
birds face from global change.”

Manuel Sanchez and Mario
<br>
Loaiza and Colombian under-
<br>
graduate student Estefania
<br>
Guzman. Colombia is home to
<br>
nearly 2,000 species of birds,
<br>
including the bare-faced ibis
<br>
(above), which Ke observed in
<br>
Santander, Colombia.
<br>
<br>
A whole new world
<br>
Based on preliminary observations, Ke thinks
<br>
that large, long-lived, non-migratory birds will
<br>
have the most trouble surviving global change.
<br>
<br>
“If that’s true, then land-use and climate change
<br>
will likely increase the number of shared species
<br>
throughout the tropics, homogenizing ecological
<br>
communities and reducing overall biodiversity.”
<br>
This summer, a scientist from Colombia will
<br>
trek through the region to build on Ke’s research.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Ke will spend the summer in
<br>
Ecuador, installing nesting boxes in forests
<br>
and on farms to see how global change affects
<br>
nesting habits.
<br>
<br>
Once again, Ke will be off to explore a whole
<br>
new world.

<br>
From June to August 2018, Ke chronicled birds
<br>
and vegetation in both agricultural and forested
<br>
settings in 12 distinct locations in Colombia’s
<br>
Magdalena Valley, from sprawling cattle ranches
<br>
to ecotourism lodges to sustenance farms.
<br>
<br>
Each morning, she awoke in a field or a
<br>
farmhouse by 4:30 a.m. so she could drive, hike,
<br>
boat or ride a horse or mule to that day’s test site
<br>
and arrive before dawn.
<br>
<br>
“That’s when the birds were most active and
<br>
the heat and humidity were most manageable,”
<br>
Ke explained.
<br>
<br>
From about 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., she would climb
<br>
mountains and ford streams to record bird sights
<br>
and sounds at various locales on that day’s
<br>
site. She usually took a break in the afternoon
<br>
when temperatures climbed above 94 degrees
<br>
Fahrenheit and humidity
<br>
hovered near 95 percent.
<br>
<br>
After about 2:30 p.m., she
<br>
would return to measure the
<br>
density of the ground cover,
<br>
bushes and trees so she
<br>
could link bird species to the
<br>
environment they prefer.
<br>
<br>
Some days, Ke was joined by a fellow scientist.
<br>
<br>
Every day, she was accompanied by a Colombian
<br>
guide. And every day, she experienced something
<br>
new. “Whether I was crossing a river on a
<br>
bamboo raft or eating guavas fresh from the tree,
<br>
I was exploring places foreigners generally don’t
<br>
go.” UC DAVIS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
