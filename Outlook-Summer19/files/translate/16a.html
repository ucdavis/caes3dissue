Farm Labor Supply
<br>
from Mexico is Falling Fast
<br>
By Diane Nelson
<br>
FOR DECADES, FARMERS in
<br>
the United
<br>
States have depended on people from
<br>
foreign countries—mostly Mexico—to
<br>
work in the fields. Only two percent of
<br>
California’s farmworkers were born in
<br>
the U.S.
<br>
<br>
But Mexico is changing. Fertility rates
<br>
are falling, rural education is rising,
<br>
and fewer young people have the need
<br>
or interest to come to America to pick
<br>
crops. California’s farm-labor supply
<br>
from Mexico has been decreasing for
<br>
several years. New data from a long-term
<br>
study by UC Davis researchers suggests
<br>
that supply will soon disappear.
<br>
<br>
“The flow of abundant labor
<br>
from Mexico is coming to an end,”
<br>
said Professor J. Edward Taylor, an
<br>
agricultural economist and co-author
<br>
of a farm-labor report commissioned by
<br>
the USDA. “Our research showed loud
<br>
and clear that changes in immigration
<br>
policy like expanding the guest-worker
<br>
program would be a stop-gap solution
<br>
at best. Farmworkers from Mexico are
<br>

<br>
aging out and fewer young workers are
<br>
interested in migrating in.”
<br>
It will be politically and logistically
<br>
hard for farmers to find plentiful, low-
<br>
wage labor from other regions. Most
<br>
developing countries are either too
<br>
small, too far away or urbanizing too
<br>
quickly. Also, Mexico’s agriculture
<br>
industry is growing rapidly, attracting
<br>
workers from Guatemala and other
<br>
countries who might otherwise be
<br>
driven to harvest crops in America.
<br>
<br>
The changes create challenges for
<br>
U.S. agriculture. UC Davis researchers
<br>
are developing mechanized harvesters,
<br>
robotic weeders and other technologies
<br>
to help farmers produce more food with
<br>
fewer workers. The new machines and
<br>
management practices require skilled
<br>
labor, which Taylor says could ultimately
<br>
benefit farming and farmworkers.
<br>
<br>
“The demand for more skilled
<br>
workers means rising productivity and
<br>
wages,” he explained. “And that could be
<br>
good for rural communities.”
<br>
Reverse migration
<br>
By the mid-20th century, most
<br>
Americans no longer worked in the
<br>
fields. U.S. growers turned to Mexico to
<br>
bolster their supply of farm labor. Some
<br>
farmworkers arrived on temporary work
<br>
visas and others crossed the border
<br>
through authorized and unauthorized
<br>
immigration. For decades, this flow of low-wage
<br>
labor helped U.S. growers increase
<br>
production of fruits, vegetables and
<br>
other crops. But the pace of immigration
<br>
has slowed dramatically. Between 2007
<br>
and 2015, the number of unauthorized
<br>
immigrants living in the U.S. declined
<br>
19 percent—from 6.9 million to
<br>
5.6 million. Researchers say more
<br>
unauthorized immigrants are returning
<br>
to Mexico than entering America.
<br>
<br>
Taylor and his team conducted
<br>
surveys with a nationally representative
<br>
sample of 2,000 rural Mexican families,
<br>
collecting data dating back to the 1980s.
<br>
<br>
They found clear trends to explain
<br>

<br>

<br>
the decline. Families are having fewer
<br>
children, more villages are building
<br>
secondary schools and the non-
<br>
agriculture economy is growing.
<br>
<br>
Taylor calculates that the number
<br>
of potential immigrants from rural
<br>
Mexico drops by about 150,000 people
<br>
every year, and U.S. growers compete with
<br>
farmers in Mexico for that shrinking pool.
<br>
<br>
“What was happening in America in
<br>
the 1900s is happening now in Mexico,”
<br>
Taylor said. “As incomes go up, the share
<br>
of workforce in agriculture plummets.
<br>
<br>
Kids in Mexico are like any other kids
<br>
with smart phones and Instagram. Are
<br>
you really going to convince them to go
<br>
out and pick lettuce?”
<br>
A new paradigm
<br>
Signs of a tightening farm labor
<br>
market are already here. Over the
<br>
last 10 years, farmworker wages have
<br>
risen, the gap between agricultural and
<br>
nonagricultural pay has narrowed and
<br>
farmers’ use of guest-worker programs
<br>
has doubled. Some farmers would like
<br>
an expanded guest-worker program, but
<br>
Taylor predicts that would provide only
<br>
temporary relief.
<br>
<br>
“Immigration policy can’t solve the
<br>
problem if workers don’t want to work in
<br>
agriculture,” he said.
<br>
<br>
Mechanization and management
<br>
efficiency may be the key. “Farmers will
<br>
have to produce more with less,” Taylor
<br>
said. “That’s the bottom line.”
<br>
Some growers have already switched
<br>
from labor-intensive crops like peaches
<br>
to crops that are harvested by machines,
<br>
such as almonds.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis researchers are developing
<br>
technology and management practices
<br>
that mechanize the care and harvest of
<br>
many other crops, such as strawberries,
<br>
lettuce and grapes. They are even creating
<br>
tractors that can distinguish a weed from
<br>
a budding crop so farmers can mechanize
<br>
labor-intensive tasks like weeding.
<br>
<br>
Technology requires skilled labor,
<br>
and Taylor emphasizes that the U.S.
<br>
<br>
“ Our research showed loud and
<br>
clear that changes in immigration
<br>
policy like expanding the
<br>
guest-worker program would
<br>
be a stop-gap solution at best.
<br>
<br>
Farmworkers from Mexico are
<br>
aging out and fewer young
<br>
workers are interested in
<br>
migrating in.
<br>
<br>
” will have to properly educate tomorrow’s
<br>
farm workforce.
<br>
<br>
“Either that, or import it from
<br>
Mexico,” he said. “Mexico graduates
<br>
more engineers per capita than the
<br>
United States. Will we see an expansion
<br>
of skilled farm labor migration in
<br>
the future?”
<br>
In any case, Taylor sees a silver lining
<br>
for agriculture and farm labor. “Fewer
<br>
workers and higher productivity means
<br>
good wages and more efficient food
<br>
production. That’s a good thing.”
