<br>

<br>

<br>
From the Dean
<br>
Department of Animal Science Professor
<br>
Ermias Kebreab was appointed associate dean
<br>
of Global Engagement and director of the
<br>
World Food Center earlier this year. This new
<br>
position replaces the CA&ES associate dean
<br>
for International Programs, a position held
<br>
previously by emeritus faculty Jan Hopmans and
<br>
Jim Hill.
<br>
<br>
A distinguished scholar and skilled
<br>
administrator, Kebreab has held several key
<br>
positions at UC Davis, including associate
<br>
vice provost of academic programs for Global
<br>
Affairs and deputy director for the Agricultural
<br>
Sustainability Institute. He is the Sesnon
<br>
Endowed Chair in the Department of Animal
<br>
Science and conducts research on using feed
<br>
additives to reduce methane emissions from
<br>
livestock. Kebreab also has done significant work
<br>
with the Food and Agriculture Organization
<br>
of the United Nations, the National Academy
<br>
of Sciences and the USDA National Animal
<br>
Nutrition Program. He is a founding member of
<br>
Dairy 2050, a think tank in scientific leadership
<br>
working toward sustainability of the U.S. dairy
<br>
industry in the global market.
<br>
<br>
With Kebreab’s significant experience and
<br>
vision for engagement, we are poised to broaden
<br>
the horizons of our international programs. In
<br>
this issue of our college magazine, we highlight a
<br>
few examples of our global engagement.
<br>
<br>
is to
<br>
promote agricultural, environmental and social
<br>
sustainability through our research, teaching
<br>
and public engagement to meet the challenges of
<br>
global change—and that’s a key distinction.
<br>
<br>
The challenges we face are not just confined
<br>
to California or to the United States. They are
<br>
increasingly of a global nature, brought about
<br>
by the needs of a growing world population.
<br>
<br>
That’s why we support students going abroad
<br>
to explore and study in other countries, why
<br>
we invest in capacity-building training and
<br>
research in emerging economies, and why we
<br>
engage in collaborative programs with academic
<br>
institutions throughout the world.
<br>
<br>
For many years, the college’s International
<br>
Programs Office (IPO) has been a focal point for
<br>
much of the work in agriculture, food, nutrition
<br>
and health in Africa, Asia and the Americas. IPO
<br>
has been extraordinarily effective at tapping
<br>
expertise within the college to build bridges
<br>
with parts of the world that need help.
<br>
<br>
Another program more recently under the
<br>
guidance of the college is the World Food
<br>
Center, charged with bringing together partners
<br>
in academia, industry and the civic sector to
<br>
promote innovative, sustainable and equitable
<br>
food systems.
<br>
<br>
With leadership changes at both the IPO and
<br>
the World Food Center, we found an opportunity
<br>
to revisit our strategy for promoting research and
<br>
outreach abroad and were fortunate to recruit a
<br>
marvelously talented individual within the college
<br>
to take over leadership.
