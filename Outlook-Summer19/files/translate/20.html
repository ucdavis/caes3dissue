Feed the Future Innovation
<br>
Lab for Horticulture
<br>
adjacent to the Arboretum has been testing horticul-
<br>
tural innovations and demonstrating best
<br>
practices for growing fruits and vegetables in
<br>
the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and
<br>
Central America.
<br>
<br>
This demonstration center—used by stu-
<br>
dents, faculty, staff and visitors from around
<br>
the world—is a project of the Feed the Future
<br>
Innovation Lab for Horticulture, which is a
<br>
federally-funded program led by UC Davis to
<br>
help small-scale farmers overcome field and
<br>
SINCE 2015, AN EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN
<br>
market challenges at low cost and with
<br>
simple, inexpensive materials. Most of this
<br>
work focuses on seed systems, vegetable
<br>
production, irrigation innovations,
<br>
conservation practices, pest management,
<br>
reducing postharvest losses, market access
<br>
and providing agricultural information.
<br>
<br>
The Horticulture Innovation Lab
<br>
Demonstration Center is open to the public
<br>
and interpretive signs and guided tours are
<br>
available to help explain what is on site.

The chimney solar dryer is built
<br>
with low-cost materials and
<br>
combines heat collection with
<br>
constant airflow for efficient
<br>
drying. Designed by UC Davis
<br>
researchers, the dryer allows
<br>
farmers to use the sun to
<br>
efficiently dry fruits, vegetables
<br>
and other foods for long-term
<br>
storage. Farmers can add value
<br>
to crop surpluses and extend
<br>
access to fruits and vegetables
<br>
throughout the year.
