Max Rothschild’s World
<br>
Pioneering alumnus charts a rewarding career improving livestock here and abroad
<br>
came to
<br>
UC Davis intending to become a veterinarian.
<br>
<br>
Instead, he embarked on a rewarding career
<br>
improving livestock both in the U.S. and in the
<br>
developing world.
<br>
<br>
“Animal science is
<br>
incredibly broad,” Rothschild
<br>
“It’s the cheapest way to
<br>
said. “There is enormous
<br>
reduce conflict, war and
<br>
opportunity for students in
<br>
disease, and it would be a
<br>
animal agriculture.”
<br>
mistake not to invest in it
<br>
The distinguished professor
<br>
at Iowa
<br>
State University helped

<br>
pioneer the application of
<br>
molecular genetics to livestock improvement. His
<br>
work on swine transformed industry breeding
<br>
practices through the identification of genes that
<br>
control reproduction, growth and meat quality.
<br>
<br>
About 90 percent of the pigs produced in the
<br>
U.S. today come from breeding stock developed
<br>
through his genetic tests.
<br>
<br>
Rothschild traces the roots of his success
<br>

<br>
to his time as an
<br>
undergraduate at UC
<br>
Davis, where animal
<br>
science professors
<br>
Eric Bradford and
<br>
Bob Laben helped
<br>
him understand
<br>
animal genetics and
<br>
encouraged him to
<br>
pursue graduate
<br>
school. “Besides being
<br>
great instructors and
<br>
advisors,” he said,
<br>
“they were just super
<br>
human beings who
<br>
helped me develop my
<br>
interest in livestock.”

MAX ROTHSCHILD (’74, ANIMAL SCIENCE)
<br>
He also met his wife and greatest supporter,
<br>
Denise Fried Rothschild (’75, biology), at
<br>
UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
A new frontier in Rothschild’s career opened
<br>
15 years ago during a visit to the Center for
<br>
Sustainable Rural Livelihoods in Uganda. “This
<br>
was a pivotal moment for me because I realized
<br>
how much genetic improvement is afforded only
<br>
to those who have great production to start with,”
<br>
he said.
<br>
<br>
Rothschild worked with Ugandan farmers to
<br>
improve basic capabilities for raising livestock,
<br>
primarily goats, pigs and chickens. “Working
<br>
there breaks all your preconceived notions about
<br>
livestock production,” he said. “What we take
<br>
for granted—shelter, climate control, water,
<br>
feed, quality animals—you don’t see that in
<br>
some villages.”
<br>
Rothschild’s work in Africa and beyond has
<br>
given him a deep appreciation for the overseas
<br>
efforts of universities like Iowa State and
<br>
UC Davis. He has traveled to more than
<br>
65 countries—from Thailand to Costa Rica—
<br>
to share his knowledge of modern animal
<br>
science techniques.
<br>
<br>
“There’s a lot of talk about whether we should
<br>
do foreign aid or not,” he said. “It’s the cheapest
<br>
way to reduce conflict, war and disease, and it
<br>
would be a mistake not to invest in it every day.”
<br>
Rothschild encourages students to keep an
<br>
open mind and be willing to explore the many
<br>
career paths in animal science. “Take a lot of
<br>
courses and internships. Talk to your professors.
<br>
<br>
And think internationally because that’s where
<br>
tremendous growth will be in the years ahead.
<br>
<br>
It’s a big world out there.”

FINAL FRAME
<br>
MATTHEW FINKLE
<br>
Study Abroad!
<br>
Matthew Finkle (’18, environmental policy and planning analysis) traveled to Australia with the UC Davis
<br>
Study Abroad program in what he says was the best educational experience of his undergraduate
<br>
career—fascinating, practical, inspiring and hands on. The program provided a unique opportunity to
<br>
make valuable connections in the scientific community, build great experience conducting scientific
<br>
research in the field, explore classic Australian terrains on class camping and research trips, and study
<br>
the Great Barrier Reef during a critical period of its existence. Learn more: studyabroad.ucdavis.edu
