“Our goal is to improve access to services that help detect
<br>
risk for depression, provide early intervention and improve
<br>
quality of life no matter where you live,” Swartz explained.
<br>
<br>
BRAIN IMAGING IN BRAZIL
<br>
The research group is called IDEA—Identifying Depression
<br>
Early in Adolescence—and represents a wide range of
<br>
disciplines. Swartz specializes in the neurobiological and
<br>
environmental factors that contribute to the risk of anxiety
<br>
and depression in adolescents.
<br>
<br>
Swartz has shown that certain brain activity can predict
<br>
susceptibility to psychiatric conditions, and that both nature
<br>
and nurture play a role in how people process stressful
<br>
situations. Swartz and her colleagues have linked childhood
<br>
poverty to changes in gene expression, brain function and the
<br>
likelihood of developing depression.
<br>
<br>
“The small, daily challenges of scraping by can build up
<br>
and affect child development,” Swartz explained.
<br>
<br>
In the current project, Swartz is expanding her research
<br>
internationally. Working with child psychiatrist Christian
<br>
Kieling from Brazil, Swartz is collecting brain scans of
<br>
about 100 teenagers in Porto Alegre, Brazil, analyzing the
<br>
teen’s brain activity in response to both threatening and
<br>
positive stimuli.
<br>
<br>
“In previous experiments in the U.S., we found that
<br>
children with higher activity in the emotion regions of the
<br>
brain and more blunted activity in the areas that process
<br>
pleasure are more at risk for depression,” Swartz said. “These
<br>
first-ever tests with teens in Brazil will help us see if those
<br>
basic brain networks behave in the same way.”
<br>
Researchers show teens pictures of angry or fearful faces to
<br>
measure brain response to threatening stimuli. To test activity
<br>
in the “reward” circuitry, the children play a computer game
<br>
in the scanner that lets them win money.
<br>
<br>
“Money usually activates the pleasure regions of the brain,”
<br>
Swartz explained.
<br>
<br>
For comparative analysis, Swartz will conduct similar
<br>
brain scans with about 100 young people ages 12 to 15
<br>
in Davis later this year. She and her team are currently
<br>
recruiting participants.
<br>
<br>
DEVELOPING A SCREENING TOOL
<br>
A simple blood test can tell doctors whether a patient is at
<br>
risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and many other conditions,
<br>
but there is no similar screening tool for depression. So Swartz
<br>
and her team are working to develop one by identifying
<br>
inflammatory “markers” in our blood stream.
<br>
<br>
“We know that many things like diet, exercise, stress and
<br>
air pollution can affect inflammation in our systems, which
<br>
can affect brain function,” Swartz said. “We don’t yet have data
<br>
to show how inflammation affects developing brain function
<br>
in teens.”
<br>
Swartz’ team will analyze the teens’ blood samples along
<br>
with brain scans to look for correlations between levels of
<br>
inflammation, brain activity and risk for depression.
<br>
<br>
“Finding those connections can lead to a basic screening
<br>
tool to help doctors treat and prevent depression before
<br>
symptoms become chronic and disruptive in young people’s
<br>
lives,” Swartz said.
<br>
<br>
IDEA’s two-year project is funded by a $2 million grant from
<br>
MQ, a mental-health charity based in the United Kingdom.
<br>
<br>
Together, the team will be gathering data from people ages 10 to
<br>
24 living in various low- and middle-income neighborhoods—
<br>
from villages in Nigeria and Nepal to cities in Brazil.
<br>
<br>
“By comparing data from adolescents in different
<br>
countries and settings, we can better understand the
<br>
cultural, social, genetic and environmental factors that can
<br>
lead to depression,” Swartz said. “And that understanding
<br>
can improve treatment, prevention and quality of life for
<br>
people throughout the world.”
