New faculty bring
<br>
fresh approaches to
<br>
society’s challenges
<br>
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ,
<br>
the College of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences has been rebuilding the ranks of our faculty. New faculty are
<br>
brought in after an intensive recruiting process that links clearly defined
<br>
goals in subject matter areas with the best academic talent. Prospective
<br>
new faculty members must also address how they would incorporate
<br>
diversity into their teaching and research programs. This methodical
<br>
approach is revitalizing our departments with exceptional faculty members
<br>
to teach our students, run cutting-edge research programs and engage
<br>
with the public to address the challenges facing society.
<br>
<br>
*These are entry-level faculty positions whose primary responsibility is undergraduate teaching.
