THE STUDENT STORY
<br>
at graduate student Lauren Howe’s home,
<br>
they know they will enjoy something
<br>
tasty, healthy and new. Howe may whip
<br>
up carrot-top pesto, for example, or
<br>
beet-greens sauté or some other dish
<br>
from ingredients other people might
<br>
throw away.
<br>
<br>
“I’m a huge proponent of ‘root-to-leaf’
<br>
cooking, where we look more creatively
<br>
and sustainably at the foods right in
<br>
front of us instead of tossing them,”
<br>
said Howe, who is a master’s student in
<br>
International Agriculture Development.
<br>
<br>
“Root-to-leaf cooking nourishes us and
<br>
helps reduce food waste.”
<br>
Howe is passionate about sustainable
<br>
diets—foods that support both human
<br>
and environmental health—and she
<br>
shares that commitment with people
<br>
around the world.
<br>
<br>
Last summer, for example, she spent
<br>
two weeks as part of a Feed the Future
<br>
WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY DINE
<br>
10 OUTLOOK SPRING/SUMMER 2019
<br>
Innovation Lab for Horticulture project
<br>
with farmers in Ethiopia, sharing ideas
<br>
on how to harvest, prepare and enjoy
<br>
sweet potato leaves.
<br>
<br>
“Before our project, most farmers
<br>
didn’t know sweet potato leaves were
<br>
edible and only used them as feed for
<br>
animals or to propagate plants,” Howe
<br>
said. “But after one taste, they were
<br>
convinced. I love it when you can
<br>
open people’s eyes to food they might
<br>
otherwise overlook, especially when you
<br>
can cultivate community along the way.”
<br>
Linking students with local farmers
<br>
In addition to her master’s studies,
<br>
Howe works as a graduate student
<br>
researcher with the Horticulture
<br>
Innovation Lab at UC Davis, which
<br>
advances fruit and vegetable innovations
<br>
to empower smallholder farmers to earn
<br>
more income while better nourishing
<br>
their communities. At the horticulture
<br>
lab, she manages the Trellis Fund,
<br>
a program that links U.S. graduate
<br>
students with local organizations to
<br>
address horticultural challenges in
<br>
developing countries.
<br>
<br>
In the last two years, Howe has
<br>
coordinated 15 Trellis Fund projects
<br>
in six countries. One of those projects
<br>
was led by a nonprofit group called
<br>
Send a Cow Ethiopia. Howe traveled as
<br>
a student fellow to southern Ethiopia in
<br>
August 2018 to work with Send a Cow
<br>
to help small farmers see sweet potato
<br>
leaves in a new culinary light.
<br>
<br>
“I was really excited when I heard
<br>
about this project because I, too, didn’t
<br>
know sweet potato leaves were edible,”
<br>
Howe said. “I learned something new!”
<br>
‘Blind’ taste test
<br>
Sweet potatoes are a staple in many
<br>
Ethiopian communities, but most
<br>
farmers don’t consider eating the leaves.
