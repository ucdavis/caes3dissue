Lauren Howe gathered with about
<br>
25 farmers in the Ukara community
<br>
of Ethiopia to harvest and taste sweet
<br>
potato leaves, which are a drought-
<br>
tolerant alternative to kale, spinach
<br>
and other greens.

For greens, they grow crops like cabbage
<br>
and kale.
<br>
<br>
“We normally only think about
<br>
eating the tuber, but the sweet potato
<br>
leaves are tasty and nutritious and can
<br>
be harvested in small quantities during
<br>
the growing season without harming
<br>
sweet-potato development,” Howe said.
<br>
<br>
“They are drought-tolerant and available
<br>
during the dry season when farmers
<br>
can’t grow kale and other leafy greens,
<br>
so they are a climate-friendly crop.”
<br>
Seeing is believing, so Howe set up
<br>
a workshop with about 25 farmers in
<br>
the Gurumo Koysha community to
<br>
harvest and taste the leaves. Together,
<br>
they cooked the leaves with a bit of oil,
<br>
onions, garlic, green chilis, cardamom
<br>
and salt and compared them in flavor to
<br>
freshly cooked kale.
<br>
<br>
“My plan was to set up a blind taste
<br>
test, but most of the farmers were
<br>
involved in the cooking so they knew
<br>
what they were tasting,” Howe said.
<br>
<br>
“And everyone shared their opinion
<br>
out loud, so we couldn’t collect private
<br>
feedback. But it was a very lively form of
<br>
outreach.” And the consensus was overwhelming:
<br>
Sweet potato leaves are yummy.
<br>
<br>
“They taste mild, kind of like
<br>
spinach, but with a little bit of a starchy
<br>
texture,” Howe said. “The farmers said
<br>
they would absolutely incorporate sweet
<br>
potato leaves into their diets. Some
<br>
farmers, in fact, prepared them for their
<br>
families that very night.”
<br>
Slow food at its best
<br>
Before entering graduate school at
<br>
UC Davis, Howe worked in Denver
<br>
for Slow Food USA, a nonprofit that
<br>
promotes sustainable diets, local food,
<br>
traditional cooking and community.
<br>
<br>
She and her partner, Dain Holland, met
<br>
through their shared love for the Slow
<br>
Food movement and still celebrate it
<br>
in their lives today. Holland is a sous
<br>
chef for UC Davis Student Housing
<br>
and Dining Services and manages
<br>
on-campus eateries at the Silo, like
<br>
Gunrock Pub.
<br>
<br>
In Ethiopia, Howe felt the power of
<br>
the slow food philosophy.
<br>
<br>
“Food is truly a universal
<br>
language, and the act of cooking
<br>
and eating transcends culture,” she
<br>
said. “Ultimately, this project was
<br>
about gathering families, friends and
<br>
neighbors to a communal meal—
<br>
already a strong practice in Ethiopia—
<br>
to share stories, experiences and hopes
<br>
for the future. What matters is that
<br>
people can sit together, enjoy a culinary
<br>
discovery and be fully supported by
<br>
their community.”
