<br>
DEPRESSION IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION that
<br>
affects millions of people around the world.
<br>
<br>
It usually starts early in life and can limit
<br>
educational, economic and social opportunities.
<br>
<br>
Early intervention can help doctors prevent
<br>
and treat depression, but there isn’t a good
<br>
screening tool, and most of what we know about
<br>
depression is based on clinical trials in high-
<br>
income countries where only a small percentage
<br>
of young people live.
<br>
<br>
“My colleague calls it the 10-90 divide,” said
<br>
Johnna Swartz, an assistant professor in the
<br>
UC Davis Department of Human Ecology.
<br>
<br>
“Ninety percent of people under the age of 18 live
<br>
in low- and middle-income countries, but only
<br>
10 percent of the research has been done there.”
<br>
Swartz is part of an international team
<br>
of experts working to identify and address
<br>
depression in young people throughout the
<br>
world. They are collecting brain images,
<br>
assessing environmental risk factors and gathering
<br>
biological data from adolescents in Brazil, Nigeria,
<br>
Nepal and the United Kingdom, as well as in
<br>
Davis, California. The team will synthesize the
<br>
data to discover universal and specific risk factors
<br>
for depression in young people.
