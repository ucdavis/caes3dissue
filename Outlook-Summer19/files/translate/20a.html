Feed the Future Innovation
<br>
Lab for Horticulture
<br>
adjacent to the Arboretum has been testing horticul-
<br>
tural innovations and demonstrating best
<br>
practices for growing fruits and vegetables in
<br>
the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and
<br>
Central America.
<br>
<br>
This demonstration center—used by stu-
<br>
dents, faculty, staff and visitors from around
<br>
the world—is a project of the Feed the Future
<br>
Innovation Lab for Horticulture, which is a
<br>
federally-funded program led by UC Davis to
<br>
help small-scale farmers overcome field and
<br>
SINCE 2015, AN EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN
<br>
market challenges at low cost and with
<br>
simple, inexpensive materials. Most of this
<br>
work focuses on seed systems, vegetable
<br>
production, irrigation innovations,
<br>
conservation practices, pest management,
<br>
reducing postharvest losses, market access
<br>
and providing agricultural information.
<br>
<br>
The Horticulture Innovation Lab
<br>
Demonstration Center is open to the public
<br>
and interpretive signs and guided tours are
<br>
available to help explain what is on site.

The chimney solar dryer is built
<br>
with low-cost materials and
<br>
combines heat collection with
<br>
constant airflow for efficient
<br>
drying. Designed by UC Davis
<br>
researchers, the dryer allows
<br>
farmers to use the sun to
<br>
efficiently dry fruits, vegetables
<br>
and other foods for long-term
<br>
storage. Farmers can add value
<br>
to crop surpluses and extend
<br>
access to fruits and vegetables
<br>
throughout the year.

<br>
The rate of postharvest loss for
<br>
fruits and vegetables exceeds
<br>
50 percent in many developing
<br>
countries. Cool storage can
<br>
greatly reduce these losses, but
<br>
is virtually non-existent in many
<br>
places because of high equip-
<br>
ment costs. The CoolBot is one
<br>
option for reducing the costs of
<br>
a cold room, using a device that
<br>
tricks an air conditioner into
<br>
further reducing temperatures
<br>
in a well-insulated room.

CA&ES manages four of the U.S.
<br>
<br>
government’s Feed the Future Innovation
<br>
Labs. These labs draw on the expertise
<br>
of top U.S. colleges and universities in
<br>
collaboration with research and educational
<br>
institutions in developing countries to
<br>
tackle some of the world’s greatest
<br>
challenges in agriculture, food security and
<br>
nutrition. In addition to the Horticulture
<br>
Innovation Lab, the other three include:
<br>
The Assets and Market Access Innovation
<br>
Lab utilizes financial, behavioral and informa-
<br>
tional innovations to help farmers. The goal is
<br>
to better understand roadblocks that keep
<br>
farmers from adopting new technologies and to
<br>
design strategies and programs that close yield
<br>
gaps, increase productivity and secure more
<br>
sustainable livelihoods.
<br>
<br>
The Genomics to Improve Poultry
<br>
Innovation Lab is working to reduce limitations
<br>
to poultry production by applying advanced
<br>
genetics and genomic approaches to enhance
<br>
innate resistance to Newcastle disease and
<br>
tolerance to heat stress in chickens in parts of
<br>
the world where this disease and hot climates
<br>
are prevalent.

The Climate Resilient Chickpea Innovation
<br>
Lab emphasizes the crop-based traits of

GREGORY URQUIAGA/UC Davis
<br>
The plants growing in raised
<br>
garden beds at the center
<br>
rotate with the seasons, but
<br>
two large beds are consistently
<br>
dedicated to vegetable varieties
<br>
commonly grown in Africa and
<br>
Asia. They include indigenous
<br>
vegetables, leafy greens, egg-
<br>
plant, squash, beans, peppers
<br>
and other specialties, such as
<br>
moringa and bittermelon.
<br>
<br>
climate resilience and nutrition, focusing genetic
<br>
improvement on the needs of smallholder
<br>
farmers in Ethiopia and India. In both countries,
<br>
chickpea is key to food security, providing a vital
<br>
source of protein nutrition and income.
