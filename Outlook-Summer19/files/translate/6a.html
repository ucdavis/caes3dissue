news/apples. SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES that
<br>
climate change would alter the rhythms of
<br>
nature, but just how and when hasn’t been easy to
<br>
predict. That’s why research, especially long-term
<br>
research, is so important.
<br>
<br>
At a remote field site in Greenland, Professor
<br>
Eric Post has studied changes in plant and animal
<br>
communities for more than a quarter century.
<br>
<br>
The UC Davis wildlife ecologist and his graduate
<br>
students document how spring is arriving weeks
<br>
earlier than it used to and what consequences that
<br>
brings for herbivores like caribou and musk oxen.
<br>
<br>
BRINGING THE SCIENCE BACK HOME
<br>
Not only is Post’s work shedding light on
<br>
ecological shifts in the Arctic, but he and
<br>
colleagues engage young students and their
<br>
teachers back home to learn about field research
<br>
taking place at the top of the world. A project
<br>
called APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning
<br>
through Engaged Science) shows K-12 teachers,
<br>
through summer workshops in the U.S., how to
<br>
deliver lessons about Greenland and climate change.
<br>
<br>
“Over the course of five days, we give them
<br>
a crash course in climate change, how to teach
<br>
climate change, how to confront climate change
<br>
denial, and how we study the effects of climate
<br>
change in the Arctic,” Post said. “We also give
<br>
them the materials and methods to replicate what
<br>
we’re doing back in their own school yards.”
<br>
More than 30 teachers from 19 states are
<br>
involved in the program, which continues to grow.
<br>
<br>
Students are able to collect data on the timing
<br>
of plant growth and share it through the APPLES
<br>
website. They also have access to the Greenland
<br>
data Post and his students are collecting and can
<br>
compare that to their own data.
<br>
<br>
One of the more interesting research tools
<br>
students get to experiment with is a time-lapse
<br>
camera, just like the 50 such cameras Post and
<br>
crew have spread out over 25 square miles of
<br>
caribou calving range. Within the span of a few

<br>
minutes, students can watch the seasons unfold through a
<br>
time-lapse movie from Greenland, with snow rapidly falling
<br>
and melting and then plants growing and flowering.
<br>
<br>
A CARIBOU HERD IN DECLINE
<br>
Perhaps the most dramatic trend the scientists have noticed
<br>
is how few caribou remain at the study site. From a maximum
<br>
of about 500 to 600 early on, numbers have dropped in the
<br>
last three years to less than 100 caribou. The reason for the
<br>
decline is unclear, but may in part relate to earlier plant
<br>
growth caused by a warmer climate.
<br>
<br>
Caribou are migratory animals. In Greenland, they remain
<br>
on the coast until springtime, when the change in day length
<br>
tells them it’s time to move eastward to their summer range
<br>
and give birth to their calves. But the “caribou cafeteria” they’re
<br>
heading to is opening and closing earlier in the year, which is
<br>
not good news if they arrive late for the buffet. The difference in
<br>
nutritional content of newly growing plants compared to older
<br>
plants is taking a toll on reproductive success.
<br>
<br>
“Caribou produce fewer calves and those calves die at a
<br>
higher rate in earlier green-up years because caribou can’t
<br>
time their arrival to coincide
<br>
with the green flush in resources
<br>
that they need to provision their
<br>
calves,” Post said. “Yet we can’t say
<br>
the decline is solely because of
<br>
climate change, because there
<br>
are many complex factors
<br>
affecting this population.”
<br>
Musk oxen, on the
<br>
other hand, seem to
<br>
be faring better. They
<br>
are already on site and don’t need to migrate to catch the
<br>
springtime pulse of new plant growth. When the cafeteria
<br>
opens earlier, that’s a huge benefit for them. One of Post’s
<br>
graduate students has documented a correlation between
<br>
advancing spring growth and musk oxen abundance in her
<br>
master’s thesis.
<br>
<br>
RAMPING UP POLAR STUDIES
<br>
Post came to UC Davis in 2016 from Penn State, where he
<br>
was a professor focused on polar science for 16 years. But he
<br>
has long been drawn to UC Davis. “As far as I’m concerned,
<br>
this is the best place for environmental research or ecology,”
<br>
he said.
<br>
<br>
Last year, Post launched the Polar Forum to engage the
<br>
academic community in this growing field. So far, the forum
<br>
has been lining up fascinating speakers like Felicity Aston,
<br>
the first woman to cross Antarctica alone, and Sergey Zimov, a
<br>
scientist behind the novel Pleistocene Park project in Siberia.
<br>
<br>
He has other projects in the works to grow this
<br>
international community of polar scientists. A seed grant
<br>
from UC Davis Global Affairs is bringing the director of
<br>
the University of Oxford Polar Forum to campus for an
<br>
exchange of ideas. He would also like to see UC Davis
<br>
offer a general polar studies course—and ultimately an
<br>
expanded curriculum.
<br>
<br>
“Research will always be important,” Post said.
<br>
<br>
“But more education and outreach are needed
<br>
because that’s the first step in mitigation or
<br>
adaptation to climate change.”
<br>
• Jeff Kerby, a former doctoral student in the Post lab, installs
<br>
a time-lapse camera on a caribou calving range near
<br>
Kangerlussuaa, Greenland. Assisting him is Ellorie McKnight,
<br>
a student volunteer from Canada. Since 2012, 50 such
<br>
cameras distributed throughout the long-term study site
<br>
have been snapping five photos daily and capturing detailed
<br>
information on trends in the timing of snow seasonality and
<br>
plant green-up as the climate warms.
