Meat Lab
<br>
finds winning cure
<br>
Dairy goat creamery coming to campus
<br>
Construction is underway on a new dairy goat parlor and creamery
<br>
just south of campus near the existing Dairy Goat Teaching and
<br>
Research Facility. The new building will include a milking parlor, milk
<br>
room, clean room, aged cheese room and packing room—everything
<br>
needed to produce and sell Grade A goat cheese while providing
<br>
exceptional opportunities for hands-on learning. About 100 students
<br>
annually take courses at the goat facility, which hosts a herd of
<br>
anywhere from 65 to 125 goats. The new building should be open
<br>
for business later this year.

We mourn the loss of Dean Emeritus
<br>
Charley Hess—a “kind and great man”

<br>
Meat Lab students found the right cure—
<br>
with beef jerky—to regain the team title
<br>
in the college section of the California
<br>
Association of Meat Processors’ Cured Meat
<br>
Competition. With the recent win, UC
<br>
Davis has now had possession of the Norm
<br>
Eggin Championship Cup for six out of the
<br>
seven years it has been awarded. In each
<br>
year’s contest, competitors are assigned
<br>
the same cured meat to prepare. This year
<br>
it was whole-muscle jerky from beef. “Our
<br>
students worked long hours researching,
<br>
trying out and tweaking the recipes and
<br>
slicing techniques until they had products
<br>
worthy of entering,” said Caleb Sehnert,
<br>
Meat Lab manager and team coach. “I
<br>
couldn’t be happier for them—or prouder.”
<br>
Charles E. “Charley” Hess, a
<br>
UC Davis Medal recipient and
<br>
dean emeritus of the College of
<br>
Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences, passed away on April 13
<br>
of congestive heart failure at the age
<br>
of 87. Hess died on Picnic Day, the
<br>
biggest celebration of the year at the
<br>
institution he so loved.
<br>
<br>
Hess was college dean from 1975
<br>
to 1989 and led the development
<br>
of the Integrated Pest Management
<br>
Program, the Student Farm and
<br>
Education Program and the
<br>
UC Davis Biotechnology Program.
<br>
<br>
He was the campus’ first director
<br>
of International Programs and he
<br>
served as vice chair of the National
<br>
Science Board, as well as USDA
<br>
assistant secretary of science
<br>
and education.
<br>
<br>
Even after Hess’ “retirement”
<br>
from UC Davis in 1994, he accepted
<br>
temporary appointments as chair
<br>
of the Department of Nutrition and
<br>
vice chancellor of research.
<br>
<br>
His many friends and colleagues
<br>
remember Hess as a “kind and
<br>
great man.”
<br>
“We would not be where we
<br>
are today without Charley’s vision
<br>
and leadership,” said Dean Helene
<br>
Dillard, who studied for her
<br>
advanced degrees at CA&ES during
<br>
Hess’ time as dean. “Charley was
<br>
a wonderful colleague, an inspira-
<br>
tional teacher, a tremendous mentor
<br>
and a dear friend to our college and
<br>
the people we serve.”
