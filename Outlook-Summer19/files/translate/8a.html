QUANTIFYING
<br>
By Diane Nelson
<br>
Researchers from the
<br>
Assets and Market Access
<br>
Innovation Lab are studying
<br>
aspirations and poverty
<br>
dynamics throughout the
<br>
world, including in rural
<br>
Nepal where many families
<br>
live on less than $1.25 a day.

<br>
in the
<br>
world live in extreme poverty, surviving
<br>
on less than $1.90 a day. Interventions
<br>
usually focus on providing tangible
<br>
resources, such as access to clean water,
<br>
nutrition, health care, education and a
<br>
viable income.
<br>
<br>
But new research from economists
<br>
in the College of Agricultural and
<br>
Environmental Sciences highlights a
<br>
psychological asset that could be equally
<br>
important: hope.
<br>
<br>
“Hope alone won’t solve global
<br>
MORE THAN 800 MILLION PEOPLE
<br>
Hope might seem
<br>
like the business of
<br>
philosophers and
<br>
motivational speakers.
<br>
<br>
But economists, too,
<br>
are exploring the
<br>
power of aspirations.
<br>
<br>
poverty,” said Professor Michael Carter,
<br>
economist and director of the Feed the
<br>
Future Innovation Lab for Assets and
<br>
Market Access at UC Davis. “But other
<br>
interventions may be more successful if
<br>
they recognize the vital role that hope
<br>
can play.”
<br>
CLOSING YOUR EYES ON A
<br>
DISMAL FUTURE
<br>
Planning for the future can improve
<br>
economic prospects. But planning
<br>
requires optimism in order to set a goal,

<br>
planned for expenditures. The poorest of
<br>
the poor didn’t look very far ahead.
<br>
<br>
“When you’re worried about what
<br>
your family will eat tomorrow, you’re not
<br>
thinking about whether your child will
<br>
get into secondary school,” Carter said.
<br>
<br>
“Closing your eyes on a gloomy future
<br>
can reduce psychological distress at the
<br>
cost of worsening your prospects for
<br>
economic well-being.”
<br>
Economic interventions can raise
<br>
aspirations. Researchers offered some
<br>
Mozambique farmers a one-time voucher
<br>
for maize seeds and fertilizer. The
<br>
farmers who used the subsidy expanded
<br>
both their farming operations and their
<br>
outlook on life.
<br>
<br>
“It appears that hope and planning
<br>
can coevolve with relaxation of
<br>
economic constraints,” Carter said.

see a pathway and believe you have the
<br>
power to take those steps. For people
<br>
trapped in poverty, the future may be
<br>
too dark to see.
<br>
<br>
“We stop wanting what we can’t
<br>
have,” Carter explained. “Otherwise, it’s
<br>
too painful.”
<br>
Researchers at the Innovation Lab
<br>
for Assets and Market Access recently
<br>
looked at aspirations among a group of
<br>
poor farmers in Mozambique. To gauge
<br>
farmers’ “time horizon,” researchers
<br>
asked participants how far out they
<br>
WHEN INTERNAL
<br>
CONSTRAINTS PERSIST
<br>
Sometimes, however, hopelessness
<br>
continues even after conditions change.
<br>
<br>
“When people are subjected to
<br>
external constraints long enough, they
<br>
can internalize those limitations,” said
<br>
Professor Travis Lybbert, a development
<br>
economist and researcher with the
<br>
Innovation Lab. “A person’s perception
<br>
of her own power can become so
<br>
degraded that she isn’t able to take
<br>
advantage of opportunities.”
<br>
In a recent experiment in Oaxaca,
<br>
Mexico, Lybbert and his colleagues
<br>
addressed those internal issues and
<br>
were able to help clients of a microcredit
<br>
bank expand their horizons. Lybbert’s
<br>
team created and then showed a
<br>
documentary to 326 indigenous women
<br>
who were eligible for small loans from
<br>
a community bank. The 15-minute
<br>
film featured four women who used
<br>
similar loans to successfully grow small
<br>
enterprises such as clothing stalls and
<br>
food stands to help their families thrive.
<br>
<br>
“Seeing women like them succeed
<br>
opened their eyes to what they could
<br>
accomplish, too,” Lybbert said.
<br>
<br>
After viewing the documentary, the
<br>
women took part in a year-long program
<br>
where they set goals, discussed hopes and
<br>
fears, and charted a course out of poverty.
<br>
<br>
“We find inspiration from people who
<br>
are like us,” Lybbert said. “It expands
<br>
our notion of what we think is possible.”
<br>
WIDENING THE LENS
<br>
Lybbert is also conducting research
<br>
in Haiti, the poorest country in the
<br>
Western Hemisphere. More than 75
<br>
percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a
<br>
day, and yet many of them spend much
<br>
of their meager wages on the lottery.
<br>
<br>
That might seem like self-defeating
<br>
behavior, but when everyone around you
<br>
is trapped in poverty, winning the lotto
<br>
can look like the only way out.
<br>
<br>
“It’s important to view behavior
<br>
through the eyes of the people making
<br>
the decisions,” Lybbert said. “That’s one
<br>
of the key insights from this research.
<br>
<br>
It provides perspective and enriches
<br>
our understanding. When we recognize
<br>
people’s internal and external constraints,
<br>
we’re better able to understand what
<br>
works to alleviate poverty.”
<br>
Carter and his team recently began
<br>
a five-year project in Kenya to measure
<br>
the role that hope plays in poor farmers’
<br>
lives. His team is also weighing whether
<br>
adding a “hope curriculum” to an asset
<br>
transfer program in Peru will increase
<br>
its impact.
<br>
<br>
“We’re looking at whether improving
<br>
the mental health of one person has a
<br>
spillover effect that can benefit families
<br>
and communities,” Carter said. “Poverty
<br>
can set up a self-reinforcing loop of stress
<br>
and despair. By addressing economic
<br>
circumstances, as well as outlook,
<br>
perhaps we can help turn a downward
<br>
spiral into an upward path.”
