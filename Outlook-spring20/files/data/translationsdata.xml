		<paragraph><![CDATA[exploring the role personality plays in the welfare ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and sustainable production of farm animals like ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[cattle, sheep and pigs. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“There’s been a lot of work done with wildlife ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[personality and foraging preference, but virtually ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nothing with cattle,” Horback said. “We know ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[with deer, birds and even insects that their level ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[of boldness can impact the risks they take and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[how far they range for food. Do those instincts ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[still apply in animals like cows that have been ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[First up: Designing tests ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[To assess a person’s personality, psychologists ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[rely on self-reporting surveys like the Myers- ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[interview cows, she and her team set up ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Creamer, a Ph.D. animal behavior student who is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[working with Horback. “We begin with cows in a ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[critical economic and ecological questions in ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Cattle distribution on ranches is a huge ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[issue,” said Assistant Professor Kristina Horback, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[a CA&ES animal-cognition expert. “When ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“Only a tiny fraction of the earth is fit for crop ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[more than 50 percent by supplementing their ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[diet with seaweed for two weeks. The seaweed ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[inhibits an enzyme in the cow’s digestive ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[system that contributes to methane production. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[In the new study, Kebreab tested whether ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[there was no drop-off in efficacy over time. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We now have a clear answer to the question of ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[groundbreaking discoveries are being ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[made that will pave the way for raising ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[healthier, more productive and better- ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[In 2018, the Ross lab reported the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[first successful effort to grow embryonic ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[stem cells from cattle in a petri dish. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[This milestone is a crucial step in the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[development of faster and more focused ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[breeding programs. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“After 40 years of attempts to do ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“We think that these cells hold huge ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[THE GENETIC CHALLENGE ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Humans have been shepherds of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[genetic selection for thousands of years ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[through the domestication of livestock ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[and crop species. But traditional methods ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[improve plants or animals with desirable ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[traits, undesirable characteristics ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[sometimes come with them. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[For instance, modern dairy cows ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[have been bred to produce milk in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[astonishing amounts—on average ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[nearly 23,500 pounds per cow per year, ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[according to the USDA. That’s far more ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[than what’s needed for the calf, but it’s ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[provided a valuable source of animal ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[protein for humans. However, selecting ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[animals with higher milk production ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[is linked to a loss of reproductive ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[efficiency. “In California we see a marked ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[decrease in fertility during the summer ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[months,” Ross said. “We know that the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[high heat period is affecting the embryos ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[in cattle. We need to understand the ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[mechanisms of heat stress on early ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[development so we can overcome or ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[correct this fertility problem.” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[A particular focus of his research is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the molecular changes that happen in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[connection with fertilization, especially ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[in the first week after the union of ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[sperm and egg that transforms these ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[cells into an embryo. “Embryonic cells ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[have the role and responsibility to form ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[all the different cell types in the body,” ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Ross said. “By developing a better ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[potential problems and opportunities ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[How life springs into form is ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[something that’s fascinated Ross ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[since he was a child growing up in ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Argentina. He initially planned to follow ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[for Caitlyn Chase, who grew up in the Trinity County ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[community of Weaverville raising chickens, pigs, lambs and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[cows as an FFA member. Her first Field Day was in 2013. ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[and 2016, she came back and competed at Field Day with ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[the forestry team from her region. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[Chase entered UC Davis as a freshman in 2016 and was ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[fairly certain she wanted to become a veterinarian. Then she ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[joined Aggie Ambassadors, the student outreach club that ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[“This is where I realized my passion is helping people ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[park his bicycle at the UC Davis Meat Lab and ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[Over a two-week period, Caleb typically ]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph><![CDATA[All animal science undergrads planning to go to ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[vet school someday must take the meat lab, and ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[for some of them it’s a little much to see how an ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[animal is harvested. ]]></paragraph>
		<paragraph><![CDATA[“There’s always a few students out in the ]]></paragraph>
