One third of California is rangeland. Good grazing management improves
<br>
rangeland productivity and provides many environmental benefits such as
<br>
capturing carbon, nourishing soil and controlling wildfire. Our college studies
<br>
topics like livestock breeding, animal-sourced nutrition, methane emissions
<br>
and cattle personality, and works closely with industry stakeholders to promote
<br>
sustainable grazing and livestock production here and abroad.

ON THE COVER
<br>
An aerial view of Chileno
<br>
Creek Ranch in Petaluma
<br>
shows cows enjoying the
<br>
green grass of spring. CA&ES
<br>
researchers collaborate with
<br>
ranchers and colleagues to
<br>
fence off creeks, provide
<br>
off-site water, reduce erosion
<br>
and manage rangeland
<br>
to support profitable,
<br>
environmentally friendly
<br>
livestock production.
