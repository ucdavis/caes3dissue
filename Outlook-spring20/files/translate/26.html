Investigates the dynamic
<br>
roles of context and culture
<br>
in children’s socioemo-
<br>
tional and academic
<br>
development to inform
<br>
interventions that promote
<br>
the well-being of children
<br>
and families
<br>
Studies how and why older
<br>
adults help other people
<br>
and how these helping
<br>
behaviors may contribute
<br>
to resilience and promote
<br>
successful aging

consequences of climate
<br>
adaptation in plants
<br>
Uses cutting edge
