FACULTY REPORT
<br>
Forging ahead with new faculty
<br>
One of the principal reasons the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences remains atop
<br>
university rankings is the quality of our faculty. We continue to grow and evolve as we bring in new
<br>
expertise through an intensive recruiting process designed to meet clearly established goals in
<br>
different subject areas. New faculty establish innovative research and teaching programs to advance
<br>
the frontiers of knowledge through multidisciplinary partnerships. They also address issues of equity
<br>
and diversity in their programs. This deliberative process is intended to provide the public with the
<br>
best talent to address society’s many challenges. This latest group of recruits includes professors and
<br>
specialists in areas such as animal science, human ecology and plant pathology.

<br>
New and early career faculty met with deans and senior
<br>
staff in November 2019 for an official welcome to the
<br>
college. Gatherings like this help build camaraderie and
<br>
provide our new faculty with knowledge to help them
<br>
become effective members of the UC Davis community.
