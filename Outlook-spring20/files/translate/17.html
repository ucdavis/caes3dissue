CRACKING THE CODE
<br>
The cattle genome was first described genes contained within the genetic code
<br>
of cattle. These genes are important
<br>
in 2009. It contains about 3 billion
<br>
because how they are expressed is what

GAME-CHANGING TECHNOLOGY
<br>
The development of technology
<br>
to harnesses the intrinsic power of
<br>
embryonic stem cells could accelerate
<br>
genetic improvement in livestock 10
<br>
times faster than what is possible today,
<br>
according to Ross. Instead of growing
<br>
individual animals to adulthood to
<br>
assess desirable traits, observations
<br>
could be made much more quickly with
<br>
cellular samples of DNA.
<br>
<br>
This approach also holds the promise
<br>
of being able to select traits for different
<br>
environments and production systems—
<br>
the right animal for the right condition.
<br>
<br>
Imagine “customizing” a cow for the
<br>
humid conditions of Florida, the cold
<br>
weather in Wisconsin or the dry heat in
<br>
California. “This could be a real game-changer
<br>
in terms of animal breeding and genetic
<br>
selection,” Ross said.
