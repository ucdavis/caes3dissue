<br>
with eggs, meat, poultry and more
<br>
get enough protein. Instead, stunted
<br>
and other undernourished children
<br>
experience what nutritionists
<br>
call “hidden hunger”—chronic
<br>
deficiencies in iron, iodine, zinc,
<br>
choline, vitamin B-12 and other
<br>
micronutrients needed for healthy
<br>
growth and brain development.
<br>
<br>
For children in developing
<br>
countries, animal-sourced
<br>
foods provide many essential
<br>
micronutrients that are hard to find
<br>
in adequate supply from plants alone.
<br>
<br>
Iron is a good example. Children
<br>
need iron as their brains, muscles
<br>
and blood cells grow. A 12-month-old
<br>
infant requires 11 milligrams of iron
<br>
each day, compared to 8 milligrams
<br>
for adults. Gram per gram, you would
<br>
need to eat eight times more spinach
<br>
than liver and four times more
<br>
spinach than beef to obtain the same
<br>
amount of iron.
<br>
<br>
“That’s because iron and
<br>
other micronutrients are more
<br>
concentrated and more bioavailable in
<br>
animal-sourced foods, which means
<br>
our bodies can more easily absorb
<br>
them,” Stewart explained. “What you
<br>
absorb is just as important as what
<br>
you consume.”
<br>
The meat connection
<br>
Fifteen years ago, CA&ES
<br>
researchers led what is still
<br>
considered the most formative
<br>
experiment on the role livestock
<br>
nutrition plays in improving
<br>
children’s growth, physical activity
<br>
and cognitive development. The
<br>
Global Livestock Collaborative
<br>
Research Support Program, directed
<br>
by former CA&ES plant sciences
<br>
professor Tag Demment, supported
<br>
a five-year project in Kenya that
<br>
tracked more than 1,000 children—
<br>
some who received two ounces of
<br>
beef on school days and some who did
<br>
not. Lindsay Allen, research professor
<br>
with the UC Davis Department of
<br>
Nutrition, helped lead the study.
<br>
<br>
Over the course of five years, the
<br>
kids who regularly ate meat scored
<br>
20 percent higher on cognitive
<br>
tests, spent more time in leadership
<br>
behaviors and were more physically
<br>
active than the children who did not.
<br>
<br>
The children’s muscle mass increased
<br>
markedly and their vitamin B-12
<br>
deficiency was eliminated.
<br>
<br>
“This seminal study shows that
<br>
the quality of food matters more than
<br>
the quantity and illustrates the link
<br>
between animal-sourced food and
<br>
child development,” Stewart said.
<br>
<br>
But beef isn’t easy to come by
<br>
in some developing nations. It can
<br>
be expensive to buy and difficult to
<br>
transport and sell. “There are many
<br>
food safety concerns when meat sits
<br>
unrefrigerated in open-air markets,”
<br>
Stewart explained. “If families are able
<br>
to afford a cow, they’re more likely to
<br>
keep it for milk or use it to help till the
<br>
soil. Getting milk, eggs and fish into
<br>
diets may be more feasible.”
<br>
That’s why Stewart and other
<br>
international nutrition experts
<br>
address world hunger with various
<br>
nutritional interventions, including
<br>
supplementing diets with a variety of
<br>
animal-sourced foods.
<br>
<br>
“When children consume diets rich
<br>
in vitamins, minerals and essential
<br>
fatty acids, they have a greater
<br>
opportunity to survive and thrive,”
<br>
Stewart said. “Animal-sourced food
<br>
is one important way to help provide
<br>
children the nutrients they need.” •
