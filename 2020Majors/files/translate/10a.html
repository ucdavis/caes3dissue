Matter at a Glance
<br>
This chart shows some lower
<br>
division prep course work
<br>
across our 28 majors. Many of
<br>
our majors’ lower division prep
<br>
courses overlap, which means
<br>
you can explore various inter-
<br>
ests while still making progress
<br>
toward your intended major.
<br>
<br>
You can also use this chart to
<br>
determine which majors match
<br>
your own interests in certain
<br>
subjects. Take some time to
<br>
consult the General Catalog
<br>
and/or reach out to our
<br>
academic advisors to learn
<br>
more about specific majors
<br>
and degree requirements.
<br>
<br>
If you are looking to transfer,
<br>
use assist.org to find available
<br>
lower division courses at your
<br>
community college to make
<br>
progress in your intended
<br>
major. Completing these lower
<br>
division courses at your
<br>
community college will help
<br>
you dive into your upper
<br>
division course work upon
<br>
transferring. This chart does not include all
<br>
preparatory subject matter. For
<br>
more information, review the
<br>
General Catalog for more
