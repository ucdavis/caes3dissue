<br>
UC Davis will lead a new global research program to build
<br>
and test ways to overcome some of the biggest challenges
<br>
for lifting and keeping rural families out of poverty in developing
<br>
countries.
<br>
<br>
The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk and
<br>
Resilience received a five-year, $30 million grant from USAID
<br>
to study the root causes of poverty and food insecurity with
<br>
emphasis on recurring risks from disasters like drought, flood
<br>
and conflict.
<br>
<br>
“As global development efforts continue to improve,
<br>
we still see humanitarian disasters that strip rural families
<br>
and communities of hard-won gains,” said Michael Carter, the
<br>
innovation lab’s director and a professor of agricultural and
<br>
resource economics at UC Davis. “We will provide needed
<br>
evidence on how to accelerate those gains and to ensure
<br>
they stick.”
