Improving human health
<br>
from inside and out
<br>
BY DIANE NELSON
<br>
EVEN WHEN HE WAS A BOY GROWING UP IN MARIN COUNTY ,
<br>
Daniel Choe wondered why some kids were more prone to
<br>
behavioral problems.
<br>
<br>
“Some of my peers got involved with drugs, fighting and
<br>
crime,” said Choe, who is now an assistant professor in the
<br>
CA&ES Department of Human Ecology. “I felt bad seeing them
<br>
damage their minds and bodies and futures. In retrospect, I
<br>
see it gave me empathy for why people make certain choices.
<br>
<br>
It made me wonder, ‘How can we prevent and treat behavioral
<br>
problems so people can lead more fulfilling lives?’.”
<br>
That question drives Choe to this day as he builds an
<br>
innovative child development program at UC Davis, where
<br>
he was hired in 2014. Choe is exploring which experiences in
<br>
early childhood can contribute to mental health problems later
<br>
in life. He looks at family and neighborhood influences, such as
<br>
poverty and violence, and a child’s capacity to “self-regulate” or
<br>
manage their emotions and behavior in stressful situations.
<br>
<br>
“We have a lot to learn about how self-control and social
<br>
competence allow children to suppress problem behaviors
<br>
and overcome environmental stressors,” said Choe. “But
<br>
interventions that only target self-regulation are not a
<br>
panacea. Aside from individual differences in people’s
<br>
ability to cope, there are also systemic, institutional reasons
<br>
why certain populations are at greater risks for breaking
<br>
the law. We need to look at it as a whole. To build healthy
<br>
communities, we have to first meet people’s basic needs.”
<br>
Marshmallows and delayed gratification
<br>
In the early 1970s, Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel
<br>
launched a long-term study on delayed gratification that still
<br>
informs the study of self-regulation.
<br>
<br>
“It’s called the marshmallow test, though we don’t use
<br>
marshmallows anymore,” Choe said. “They’re considered a
<br>
choking hazard.”
<br>
The experiment works like this: A child about 4 to 6
<br>
years old sits in a room with a small treat. The youngster is
<br>
given the option of eating it now or getting two treats if he or
<br>
she can wait maybe 15 minutes. Decades later, researchers
<br>
discovered that the children who waited longer for the reward
<br>
were significantly more likely to lead healthy and successful
<br>
lives as measured by things like Body Mass Index, SAT scores,

<br>
lucrative jobs and stable
<br>
relationships. “The positive effects of
<br>
early self-regulation were
<br>
more powerful than children’s
<br>
IQ and family income in
<br>
predicting success later in life,”
<br>
Choe said.
<br>
<br>
Choe recently received a
<br>
UC Davis Hellman Fellowship
<br>
Award, which supports early-
<br>
career faculty, to investigate
<br>
the development of self-
<br>
regulation in children and
<br>
families in Yolo County.
<br>
<br>
Choe’s lab uses a form of
<br>
the marshmallow test along
<br>
with other methods to assess
<br>
impulse control and resilience
<br>
to adversity. Choe also studies
<br>
intergenerational family
<br>
dynamics, because how we
<br>
were raised influences our own
<br>
parenting behavior. And he
<br>
measures parental stress and maternal mood.
<br>
<br>
“A mother’s depression is a risk factor for a whole host of
<br>
problems, including difficulties self-regulating,” Choe said.
<br>
<br>
“That’s why addressing institutional issues—like adopting
<br>
reasonable family leave policies—is so important to child
<br>
welfare. It’s all connected.”
<br>
Trust matters
<br>
Trust plays a big role in self-regulation and the choices
<br>
we make.
<br>
<br>
“Sometimes, what looks like a bad decision can be perfectly
<br>
reasonable based on experience,” Choe said.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, psychologists have conducted variations
<br>
of the marshmallow test. In one permutation, some children
<br>
worked with a trustworthy adult and others did not.
<br>
<br>
“The untrustworthy adult would promise to bring the child
<br>
nice crayons, for example, and show up with a few broken
