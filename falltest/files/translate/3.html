Delivering health

<br>
MAGAZINE FALL/WINTER 2019
<br>
Our college is committed to supporting
<br>
vibrant communities. On virtually any
<br>
day, you will find students delivering fresh
<br>
produce to underserved communities, for
<br>
example, and faculty working with diverse
<br>
groups to explore ways to improve the
<br>
air we breathe, the food we eat, the water
<br>
we drink and the neighborhoods we call
<br>
home. In this issue, we feature efforts to
<br>
save citrus, promote food safety, protect
<br>
air quality after wildfires, enhance child
<br>
development and a host of other projects
<br>
to foster health and well-being.

ON THE COVER
<br>
Farmer Richard Bennett peels
<br>
a tangerine in an orchard
<br>
across from his home in Exeter,
<br>
California. CA&ES researchers
<br>
are working with farmers like
<br>
Bennett to save citrus from a
<br>
devastating disease that has
<br>
now reached California, where
<br>
much of the world’s fresh citrus
<br>
is grown.
