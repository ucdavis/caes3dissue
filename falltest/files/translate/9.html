This car and home on Panorama Point in Paradise
<br>
was among the thousands to burn in November
<br>
2018 during the devastating Camp Fire, which
<br>
produced thick smoke throughout the Sacramento
<br>
Valley. Researchers collected air samples at
<br>
UC Davis during the fire to study the contents of
<br>
the smoke. caes.ucdavis.edu/news/smoke

pose the greatest health risks such as
<br>
cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks,
<br>
and respiratory effects such as asthma
<br>
attacks and bronchitis.
<br>
<br>
The daily standard for maximum
<br>
exposure to PM2.5 levels is 35
<br>
micrograms per cubic meter of air.
<br>
<br>
During the Camp Fire, levels exceeded
<br>
300 micrograms in parts of the
<br>
region—some of the worst air quality
<br>
in the world at the time. “That’s really
<br>
hazardous on its own,” Zhang said.
<br>
<br>
“When we look more closely at the
<br>
composition of the particulate matter,
<br>
it could be even more concerning.”
<br>
So just how concerned should
<br>
people be about breathing smoke
<br>
from wildfires? The concentration of
<br>
atmospheric pollutants is higher during
<br>
wildfire events, but Wexler cautions
<br>
against being alarmist: “The health
<br>
effects of the anxiety about smoke may
<br>
be worse than the health effects of the
<br>
smoke itself. Nonetheless, individuals
<br>
with asthma and other respiratory
<br>
conditions are definitely at risk from
<br>
wildfire smoke.”
<br>
Susceptible populations, such as
<br>
the young, are most at risk. In 2008,
<br>
a number of wildfires filled the valley
<br>
with smoke. Lisa Miller, a veterinary
<br>
medicine professor and researcher at
<br>
the primate center on campus, studied
<br>
monkeys born that year and compared
<br>
them with monkeys born a year later
<br>
when the air was clear. Her research
<br>
showed that infant monkeys exposed to
<br>
wildfire smoke had an immune system
<br>
with a depressed ability to respond to
<br>
infectious agents when they became
<br>
adolescents. There are other considerations
<br>
brought by wildland fires burning in
<br>
areas with homes and other urban
<br>
development. After the Santa Rosa
<br>
fires of 2017, local citizens were
<br>
concerned about the impact of toxic
<br>
air contaminants on locally grown
<br>
produce. However, a study with the
<br>
help of UC Cooperative Extension in
<br>
Sonoma County found that produce
<br>
safety was not significantly affected.
<br>
<br>
An analysis of eggs from backyard
<br>
chickens in the area by the School of
<br>
Veterinary Medicine found a small
<br>
percentage of properties affected by
<br>
lead contamination but no obvious
<br>
association with proximity to wildfire.
<br>
<br>
Scientists acknowledge there is much
<br>
to learn about wildfires and the smoke
<br>
they produce. “Wildfires have become
<br>
such a common phenomenon,” Zhang
<br>
said. “There are a lot of unknowns when
<br>
these particles are emitted, what the
<br>
implications for human health are, and
<br>
what the implication for the regional
<br>
climate is. A lot of study needs to be
<br>
performed.” •
<br>
Plans in place to deal
<br>
with wildfire impacts
<br>
If wildfire smoke descends again
<br>
upon the campus as it did last
<br>
November, UC Davis will be
<br>
ready. Contingency plans have
<br>
been developed to deal with smoke
<br>
and other potential wildfire impacts.
